Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

The name carries connotations of being connected to the earth, having leadership qualities, and possessing royal/noble characteristics according to Hindu traditions.\n\nSo in summary, Parthiv is a meaningful Hindu boy's name with royal and earthy associations, most famously held by the Indian cricket player Parthiv Patel in recent times.",

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter.

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

The name carries connotations of being connected to the earth, having leadership qualities, and possessing royal/noble characteristics according to Hindu traditions.\n\nSo in summary, Parthiv is a meaningful Hindu boy's name with royal and earthy associations, most famously held by the Indian cricket player Parthiv Patel in recent times.",

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter.

Having lost a finger at the age of 6, he initially found it hard to keep wickets, but after enough practice, he got used to it.[3] When Patel played for the Indian team in 2002, he became the youngest wicket-keeper to represent a country in Tests. He was a part of the Indian squad which won the [2016 Asia Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Asia_Cup).\n\nIn December 2020, Patel announced his retirement from all forms of cricket.[4] After his retirement, Patel joined Mumbai Indians as a Talent Scout.[5] He is also now seen as a commentator in the Indian Premier League and International Matches too.\n\nIn November 2024, Patel was appointed as the assistant and batting coach of [Gujarat Titans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gujarat_Titans) for the upcoming season of the [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League).[6]\n\n## Domestic career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=1)]\n\nPatel led the Gujarat side in the [2016\u201317 Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Ranji_Trophy). Beating [Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odisha_cricket_team) and [Jharkhand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jharkhand_cricket_team) in the quarterfinal and semifinal, the team reached the final for only the second time. In the final in January, they met defending champions [Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_cricket_team) in Indore. Patel scored 90 in the first inning and 143 in the second and helped beat Gujarat to win its first Trophy.[7] Patel's 143 was the highest in a successful chase in a [Ranji Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranji_Trophy) final. The win also made Gujarat the first team and Patel the first captain to have won all three major titles in domestic cricket in India.[8]\n\nIn July 2018, he was named as the captain for India Green for the [2018\u201319 Duleep Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018%E2%80%9319_Duleep_Trophy).[9] In October 2019, he was named as the captain of [India B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India_B_cricket_team) for the [2019\u201320 Deodhar Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_Deodhar_Trophy).[10]\n\n### Indian Premier League\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=2)]\n\nPatel was auctioned in the inaugural [Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Premier_League) (IPL) to [Chennai Super Kings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Super_Kings).[11] He used to be a regular in the team and opened with the former Australian opener [Matthew Hayden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Hayden). He did not keep wicket as the Indian wicketkeeper as captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) was in the team. For the fourth season, he was signed by [Kochi Tuskers Kerala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochi_Tuskers_Kerala). On 16 May, it was announced that Parthiv will be leading the Kochi Tuskers Kerala for the rest of the [2011 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Indian_Premier_League).[12] As a result of the termination of Kochi Tuskers franchise, Parthiv along with the other players from the franchise was once again auctioned for the [2012 Indian Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Indian_Premier_League) season. He was picked by [Deccan Chargers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Chargers) for $1m During the 2012 IPL Trading Window. Parthiv was picked up by [Sunrisers Hyderabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrisers_Hyderabad) in 2013 and by [Royal Challenger Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challenger_Bangalore) in 2014. Patel was signed by [Mumbai Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai_Indians) for the 2015 IPL as an [opening batsmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batting_order_(cricket)).[13]\n\nIn January 2018, he was bought by the [Royal Challengers Bangalore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Challengers_Bangalore) in the [2018 IPL auction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2018_Indian_Premier_League_personnel_changes).[14][15]\n\n### Other franchise cricket\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=3)]\n\nIn 2022, Gujarat Giants selected him in the Legends League Cricket and gave him the captaincy in the 2023 Legends League Cricket season.[16]\n\n## International career\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=4)]\n\nParthiv debuted in the year 2002 against England at Trent Bridge at 17 years and 153 days to become Test Cricket's youngest wicketkeeper. He had replaced the injured Ajay Ratra and eclipsed the record previously held by Pakistan's Hanif Mohammed (17 years and 300 days). He played out an hour in the match while batting and hence saved India from defeat. However, with the emergence of Dhoni and poor wicketkeeping, he was sidelined for a few matches in 2004.[17]\n\nOn 23 November 2016, Parthiv Patel was called up as a replacement for the regular wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) who had a thigh strain, for the third Test (at [Mohali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_Cricket_Association_IS_Bindra_Stadium)) of the [India-England home series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_cricket_team_in_India_in_2016%E2%80%9317).[18] He played his first Test in eight years, having missed 83 Test matches between appearances.[19]\n\nPatel made his [ODI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Day_International) debut against [New Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_cricket_team) in January 2003.[20] He was selected in the Indian squad for the [2003 Cricket World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_Cricket_World_Cup) but did not play any games, with [Rahul Dravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahul_Dravid) being used as a makeshift wicket-keeper to allow the use of an extra batsman or bowler. With this policy in place, Patel only made intermittent appearances in ODIs, usually when Dravid was injured or being rested (in full or from wicket-keeping duties). He played 13 ODIs in a two-year span, and during an interrupted career managed only an average of 14.66 and a top-score of 28 and was dropped thereafter. Parthiv returned to the Indian team in 2010 in the 4th and 5th Odi vs New Zealand. He celebrated this moment by hitting two back to back half centuries. Later on he was called up for replacing injured Sachin Tendulkar in India tour South Africa .[21]\n\n### Tour of West Indies 2011\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=5)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper captain [MS Dhoni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni) rested for the tour along with several seniors such as [Sachin Tendulkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachin_Tendulkar), [Zaheer Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zaheer_Khan), he was entrusted with the job of wicket-keeping in the tour along with Wriddhiman Saha. In the lone T20I match played in the tour, he made his T20I debut at the [Queen's Park Oval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen%27s_Park_Oval) at [Port-of-Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port-of-Spain). He opened the batting along with another left-handed debutante [Shikhar Dhawan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikhar_Dhawan) and made a 26 from 20 balls. In the second ODI against West Indies he scored 56 [not out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_out).\n\n### England tour of India 2016\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=6)]\n\nWith wicket-keeper [Wriddhiman Saha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wriddhiman_Saha) injured, Parthiv was called to test team duty for the third test in Mohali. He proved the selectors' decision was right with two good innings including an unbeaten 67 runs from 54 balls in the second innings which led India to victory.\n\n### One of the Indian cricketers to play T20 match in 2005\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=7)]\n\nParthiv Patel, along with Robin Singh and Rohan Gavaskar played their first T20 match in 2005.[22] This was the early phase of t20 format. But the first Indian cricketer to play a t20 match was Dinesh Mongia.[23] He played his debut match in July 2004.\n\n## References\n\n[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parthiv_Patel&action=edit&section=8)]\n\n1. ^ \"Rising to great heights\".

For your question about Parthiv, I first checked several reliable reference books and cultural guides - kind of like going through an encyclopedia at the library. Since this was asking about a name's meaning and history (not medical advice), I knew I could safely share what I found. I looked through trusted sources to learn about the name's Sanskrit origins, its meaning, and the most well-known person who has this name - Parthiv Patel, the cricket player. Then I organized everything in a friendly way, like I was explaining it to a friend, making sure to include interesting facts about both the name's meaning and its real-world use today. I always double-check my facts before sharing, just like a careful librarian would!\"",
