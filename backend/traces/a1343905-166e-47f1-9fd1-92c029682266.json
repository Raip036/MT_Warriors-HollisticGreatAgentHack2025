            "trace_explanation_user_friendly": "Here's how I found this answer for you:\n\nWhen you told me you were sick, I first needed to make sure I could help safely - like a pharmacy assistant checking if they should refer someone to a doctor. Since you didn't mention specific symptoms, I gathered general wellness tips from trusted medical sources (kind of like checking a reliable health handbook). Then, I organized the information into simple, friendly advice while being very careful to emphasize that you should see a healthcare provider for proper evaluation. It's similar to how a helpful pharmacy assistant would give basic wellness tips while encouraging you to get proper medical care if needed. I made sure to double-check everything and keep the advice general and safe since I can't diagnose specific conditions.",
