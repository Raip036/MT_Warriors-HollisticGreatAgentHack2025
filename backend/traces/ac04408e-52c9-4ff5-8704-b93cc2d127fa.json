That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects.

Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label.

OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions.

If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place. Medicines can go bad in places that are damp and warm, like the kitchen or bathroom. - Keep medicines away from children and pets. Using a locked box, cabinet, or closet is best.

The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

                "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label.

OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions.

If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place. Medicines can go bad in places that are damp and warm, like the kitchen or bathroom. - Keep medicines away from children and pets. Using a locked box, cabinet, or closet is best.

Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

                "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

          "content": "Ondansetron\n\npronounced as (on dan' se tron)\n\n- [Why is this medication prescribed?](#why) - [How should this medicine be used?](#how) - [Other uses for this medicine](#other-uses) - [What special precautions should I follow?](#precautions) - [What special dietary instructions should I follow?](#special-dietary) - [What should I do if I forget a dose?](#if-i-forget) - [What side effects can this medication cause?](#side-effects) - [What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?](#storage-conditions) - [In case of emergency/overdose](#overdose) - [What other information should I know?](#other-information) - [Brand names](#brand-name-1)\n\n## Why is this medication prescribed?\n\nOndansetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Ondansetron is in a class of medications called serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of serotonin, a natural substance that may cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n## How should this medicine be used?\n\nOndansetron comes as a tablet, a rapidly disintegrating (dissolving) tablet, film, and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The first dose of ondansetron is usually taken 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, 1 to 2 hours before the start of radiation therapy, or 1 hour before surgery. Additional doses are sometimes taken one to three times a day during chemotherapy or radiation therapy and for 1 to 2 days after the end of treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ondansetron exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Do not chew the film.If you are taking the rapidly disintegrating tablet, remove the tablet from the package just before you take your dose. To open the package, do not try to push the tablet through the foil backing of the blister. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil backing.

          "content": "Taking medicines - what to ask your provider\n\nTalking to your health care providers about your medicines can help you learn to take them safely and effectively.\n\n## Take Charge of Your Health\n\nMany people take medicines every day. You might need to take medicine for an infection or to treat a long-term ([chronic](https://medlineplus.gov/article/002312.htm)) illness.\n\nTake charge of your health. Ask your providers questions and learn about the medicine you take.\n\nKnow what medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements you take.\n\n- Make a list of your medicines to keep in your wallet. - Take time to understand the purpose of your medicine. - Ask your provider questions when you do not know the meaning of medical words, or when instructions aren't clear.

Ask questions, such as:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine? - Why am I taking this medicine? - What is the name of the condition this medicine will treat? - How long will it take to work? - How should I store the medicine? Does it need to be refrigerated? - Can the pharmacist substitute a cheaper, generic form of the medicine? - Will the medicine create conflicts with other medicines I take?\n\n## Find Out How to Take the Medicine\n\nAsk your provider or pharmacist about the right way to take your medicine. Ask questions, such as:\n\n- When and how often should I take the medicine? As needed, or on a schedule? - Do I take medicine before, with, or between meals? - How long will I have to take it?\n\n## Know What to Expect With the New Medicine\n\nAsk about how you will feel.\n\n- How will I feel once I start taking this medicine? - How will I know if this medicine is working? - What side effects might I expect?

How much? - Is it OK to eat or drink food before or after I take the medicine?\n\nAsk other questions, such as:\n\n- If I forget to take it, what should I do? - What should I do if I feel I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to just stop?\n\n## When to Call the Doctor\n\nContact your provider or pharmacist if:\n\n- You have questions or you are confused or uncertain about the directions for your medicine. - You are having side effects from the medicine. Do not stop taking the medicine without telling your provider. You might need a different dose or a different medicine. - Your medicine looks different than you expected. - Your refill medicine is different than what you usually get.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nMedications - taking\n\n## References\n\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality website.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment. You may also want to make a copy to give to a family member or friend in case you have a medical emergency. - Read and save any information that comes with your medicine. - Keep your medicine in the box or bottle it came in so you have all the information from the label. - Pay attention to the color and shape of your pills. If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place.

          "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Before sharing sensitive information, make sure you\u2019re on a federal government site.\n\nThe site is secure. The https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely.\n\n# Taking Medicines Safely as You Age\n\n# Taking Medicines Safely as You Age\n\nEspa\u00f1ol\n\nMedicines are intended to help us live longer and healthier, but taking medicines the wrong way or mixing certain drugs and supplements can be dangerous. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

          "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

Ondansetron is in a class of medications called serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of serotonin, a natural substance that may cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n## How should this medicine be used?\n\nOndansetron comes as a tablet, a rapidly disintegrating (dissolving) tablet, film, and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The first dose of ondansetron is usually taken 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, 1 to 2 hours before the start of radiation therapy, or 1 hour before surgery.

If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\n[7] Taking Medicines Safely as You Age | National Institute on Aging\nURL: https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/medicines-and-medication-management/taking-medicines-safely-you-age?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\nThe .gov means it\u2019s official.

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working?

Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area.

Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE\n\nTASKS:\n1.

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1. Inform your healthcare provider\n2. Report directly to Sanofi through our reporting system\n\n*Reporting tool available in English and French. Also, you can report the adverse event to your local Sanofi affiliate, through country-specific Sanofi Web Page*\n\n## Report an adverse event\n\nReporting tool available in English and French.

You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment.

            "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)?

Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.\n\nTaking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.\n\nIf you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n## Taking medicines safely\n\nHere are some tips to help you take your medicines safely:\n\n- Follow instructions. Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

            "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication?

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects.

[Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

                "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

                "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication?

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

Ondansetron is in a class of medications called serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of serotonin, a natural substance that may cause nausea and vomiting.\n\n## How should this medicine be used?\n\nOndansetron comes as a tablet, a rapidly disintegrating (dissolving) tablet, film, and an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The first dose of ondansetron is usually taken 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy, 1 to 2 hours before the start of radiation therapy, or 1 hour before surgery. Additional doses are sometimes taken one to three times a day during chemotherapy or radiation therapy and for 1 to 2 days after the end of treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ondansetron exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Do not chew the film.If you are taking the rapidly disintegrating tablet, remove the tablet from the package just before you take your dose. To open the package, do not try to push the tablet through the foil backing of the blister. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil backing. Gently remove the tablet and immediately place the tablet on the top of your tongue. The tablet will dissolve in a few seconds and can be swallowed with saliva.\n\n## Other uses for this medicine\n\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment. You may also want to make a copy to give to a family member or friend in case you have a medical emergency. - Read and save any information that comes with your medicine. - Keep your medicine in the box or bottle it came in so you have all the information from the label. - Pay attention to the color and shape of your pills. If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place.

                  "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not?

How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                  "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication?

Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine.

              "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

              "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

              "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment. You may also want to make a copy to give to a family member or friend in case you have a medical emergency. - Read and save any information that comes with your medicine. - Keep your medicine in the box or bottle it came in so you have all the information from the label. - Pay attention to the color and shape of your pills. If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place. Medicines can go bad in places that are damp and warm, like the kitchen or bathroom. - Keep medicines away from children and pets. Using a locked box, cabinet, or closet is best. [Get more tips for how to keep medicines away from children](http://www.upandaway.org/). - Get rid of expired (out-of-date) medicines and medicines you no longer use.

              "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

              "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine.

              "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working?

Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

              "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

              "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

Additional doses are sometimes taken one to three times a day during chemotherapy or radiation therapy and for 1 to 2 days after the end of treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ondansetron exactly as directed.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment. You may also want to make a copy to give to a family member or friend in case you have a medical emergency. - Read and save any information that comes with your medicine. - Keep your medicine in the box or bottle it came in so you have all the information from the label. - Pay attention to the color and shape of your pills. If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place.

                "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working?

If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication?

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine.

                "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

                "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1. Inform your healthcare provider\n2. Report directly to Sanofi through our reporting system\n\n*Reporting tool available in English and French. Also, you can report the adverse event to your local Sanofi affiliate, through country-specific Sanofi Web Page*\n\n## Report an adverse event\n\nReporting tool available in English and French. Also, you can report the adverse event to your local Sanofi affiliate, through country-specific Sanofi Web Page.\n\nReport an adverse event\n\nPatient Support\n\n## Why Medication Safety Matters ?\n\nMedicines offer proven benefits through rigorous testing, but each individual can respond uniquely to the treatment and present adverse events.

You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment.

              "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.\n\nTaking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.\n\nIf you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n## Taking medicines safely\n\nHere are some tips to help you take your medicines safely:\n\n- Follow instructions. Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

              "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label.

OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions.

If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place. Medicines can go bad in places that are damp and warm, like the kitchen or bathroom. - Keep medicines away from children and pets. Using a locked box, cabinet, or closet is best.

The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

              "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines.

              "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1. Inform your healthcare provider\n2. Report directly to Sanofi through our reporting system\n\n*Reporting tool available in English and French.

This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf).

Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place.

              "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas.

People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.\n\nTaking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.\n\nIf you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n## Taking medicines safely\n\nHere are some tips to help you take your medicines safely:\n\n- Follow instructions. Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

              "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

That's why it's important to:\n\n- Know what to expect from your medication\n- Take your medicine exactly as prescribed\n- Report any Adverse Events\n\n## Five Essential Tips for Medication Safety\n\nBefore starting any new medication, make sure you understand both its benefits and potential risks.\n\n### Make a Complete Medication List Before Going to an Appointment With Your HCP\n\nKeep a simple list of all your health products:\n\n- Prescription medications\n- Over-the-counter treatments\n- Vitamins and supplements\n- Even some foods can matter (like grapefruit or green tea)\n\n### Ask Questions\n\nTalk to your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist about your medicine. You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication? Does it need refrigeration?\"\n\n### Read Packaging Information Carefully\n\nAlways check labels and package inserts for:\n\n- Does it require any special preparation process (eg: reconstitution) and storage?\n- What is the best way to take your medicine: period of the day, maximum daily dose, frequency\n- How your medicine might interact with other things you take\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\n### Store and Dispose Your Medication Safely\n\nHelp ensure that your medicines do not pose a risk others and the environment:\n\n- Keep your medicine out of reach of children\n- Check your medicine cabinet and remove all expired and unused prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products.\n- Bring unused and expired prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications and natural health products to your local pharmacist for proper disposal.\n- Do not flush medicines down the toilet or sink. Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us. Pharmacovigilance depends on you. When you report adverse events to the company you help improve safety for everyone.\n\nIf you experience any Adverse Events while taking a Sanofi medicine:\n\n1.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label.

OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions.

If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place. Medicines can go bad in places that are damp and warm, like the kitchen or bathroom. - Keep medicines away from children and pets. Using a locked box, cabinet, or closet is best.

Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

                "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation.

Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

Additional doses are sometimes taken one to three times a day during chemotherapy or radiation therapy and for 1 to 2 days after the end of treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ondansetron exactly as directed.

Does it need to be refrigerated? - Can the pharmacist substitute a cheaper, generic form of the medicine? - Will the medicine create conflicts with other medicines I take?\n\n## Find Out How to Take the Medicine\n\nAsk your provider or pharmacist about the right way to take your medicine. Ask questions, such as:\n\n- When and how often should I take the medicine? As needed, or on a schedule? - Do I take medicine before, with, or between meals? - How long will I have to take it?\n\n## Know What to Expect With the New Medicine\n\nAsk about how you will feel.\n\n- How will I feel once I start taking this medicine? - How will I know if this medicine is working? - What side effects might I expect?

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment. You may also want to make a copy to give to a family member or friend in case you have a medical emergency. - Read and save any information that comes with your medicine. - Keep your medicine in the box or bottle it came in so you have all the information from the label. - Pay attention to the color and shape of your pills. If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place.

                "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

Additional doses are sometimes taken one to three times a day during chemotherapy or radiation therapy and for 1 to 2 days after the end of treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ondansetron exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.Do not chew the film.If you are taking the rapidly disintegrating tablet, remove the tablet from the package just before you take your dose.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects. But you can lower your chances of side effects from medicines by carefully following the directions on the medicine label or from your pharmacist, doctor, or nurse.\n\nSide effects may be mild, like an upset stomach. Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label. The information on this label can help you choose the right OTC medicine for your symptoms.\n\nThe Drug Facts label also gives you instructions for using the medicine safely. OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines. [Learn more about using OTC medicines safely](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000882.htm).\n\nIf you notice unpleasant side effects after taking medicine, like feeling dizzy or having an upset stomach, call your doctor or nurse.\n\n#### Ask questions to make sure you understand.\n\nTo use a medicine safely, you need to know:\n\n- The name of the medicine - Why you're using the medicine - How to use the medicine the right way - If there are any medicines you need to avoid while you\u2019re taking this one - What the side effects could be - What to do if you start having side effects - How to store medicine safely \u2014 and how to safely get rid of leftover or unused medicine\n\nAsk your doctor or nurse questions to be sure you understand how to use your medicine. Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions. [Use these tips to talk with a pharmacist about your medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm163330.htm).\n\n### Keep Track\n\n#### Keep track of your medicines.\n\nFollow these tips to help you keep track of your medicines:\n\n- [Use this resource to make a list of the medicines you use [PDF - 156 KB]](https://ods.od.nih.gov/pubs/DietarySupplementandMedicineRecord.pdf). Write down how much you use and when you use each medicine \u2014 and make sure to include any dietary supplements (vitamins, minerals, or herbs) you take. - Take the list with you whenever you go to a medical appointment. You may also want to make a copy to give to a family member or friend in case you have a medical emergency. - Read and save any information that comes with your medicine. - Keep your medicine in the box or bottle it came in so you have all the information from the label. - Pay attention to the color and shape of your pills. If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place.

                "content": "For many people, taking medication is a regular part of their daily routine, and these medicines are relied upon to treat disease and improve health. Although medicines can make you feel better and help you get well, it's important to know that all medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, have risks as well as benefits\n\nThe benefits of medicines are the helpful effects you get when you use them, such as lowering blood pressure, curing infection, or relieving pain. The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?\n\n- Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?\n\n- What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?\n\n- Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not?

Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"

You might want to ask:\n\n- \"How will it help my condition?\"\n- \"What side effects might I notice?\"\n- \"When should I take it: morning, night or before going to bed?\n- \u201cHow should I take it With food or without?\"\n- \"Will it work well with my other medications or vitamins?\"\n- \"How should I store this medication?

Unused or expired medicines are hazardous waste that **must not be thrown in the common trash**. Check your local Health Authority website for specific instructions.\n\n### Speak Up If You're Worried\n\nIf you have concerns after starting a medication or think you might be experiencing a adverse event, contact your healthcare provider promptly. You can also report any adverse events experience during a treatment with a Sanofi medication.\n\n## How Patient Safety & Pharmacovigilance Team Monitors Your Safety at Sanofi\n\nPharmacovigilance is our commitment to your safety throughout the entire lifecycle of every medication.\n\n### What Is Pharmacovigilance?\n\nPharmacovigilance is the science of detecting, assessing, understanding, and preventing adverse effects from medications and vaccines. This continuous process:\n\n- Protects patients and public health\n- Monitors medications throughout their lifecycle\n- Updates safety information as new data emerges\n- Evaluates the need of additional actions (eg: safety communication or materials to healthcare providers and patients) to maximize medications' benefits and minimize its risks.\n\n### How Pharmacovigilance Works\n\nOur safety monitoring process follows three key steps:\n\n#### Gathering information\n\nabout potential adverse events from patients, healthcare providers, and research\n\n#### Analyzing data\n\nto identify patterns and understand risks\n\n#### Implementing knowledge\n\nby updating information for healthcare providers and patients\n\n### The Sanofi Approach to Patient Safety\n\nOur patient-centric model features:\n\n- Structured benefit-risk assessment for efficient safety analysis\n- Rapid processes from detection to patient information updates\n- Advanced technology including AI (Artificial intelligence) and machine learning\n\nDiane Zhu, Marketing, Brand & Innovation, China\n\n### What is an Adverse Event?\n\nAn Adverse Event (or \u201cside effect\u201d) is any negative or unwanted medical experience a patient has after taking a medicinal product (like a medication or treatment).\n\nIt's important to know that an Adverse Event doesn't necessarily have to be caused by the medicine. There might not be a direct causal relationship.\n\nSo, an Adverse Event could be:\n\n- An unexpected sign (like an unusual lab test result your doctor finds).\n- A symptom you feel (like nausea or a headache).\n- A new disease or illness that appears.\n- An existing condition getting worse.\n\nBasically, it's any unfavorable health change that happens while someone is using a medicinal product, whether or not we think the product is the reason for it. Example: A patient felt nausea after taking a Sanofi sleeping pill. (This is reported as an Adverse Event, even if we don't know for sure if the pill caused the nausea). Example: A patient who usually has minor migraine headaches noticed they became more severe and frequent after starting treatment with a Sanofi product.\n\n### Understanding Drug Interactions: Why They Matter\n\nWhen two or more medications mix in your body, they can affect how each other works. This is called a drug interaction. These interactions matter because they can:\n\n- Make medications less effective. Some drugs can prevent others from working properly, leaving health conditions untreated.\n- Increase adverse events. Interactions can amplify unwanted effects, making you feel worse instead of better.\n- Create unexpected reactions. Sometimes combinations produce entirely new effects that neither drug would cause alone.\n\nDrug interactions don't just happen with prescription medications. Over-the-counter medicines, supplements, foods, and even alcohol can interact with your medications. This is why it's crucial to tell your doctor and pharmacist about everything you take, even vitamins or herbal supplements.\n\nAlways check with healthcare professionals before starting new medications to stay safe and ensure your treatments work as intended.\n\nDr Yohana Mokiwa with a patient, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania\n\n## How You Can Help Improve Medication Safety\n\nYour experiences matter to us.

But if you don\u2019t follow the directions, medicines can harm you.\n\nAny medicine can have side effects.

Other side effects \u2014 like damage to your liver \u2014 can be more serious. Some side effects can even be deadly.\n\nTake these steps to avoid problems with medicines:\n\n- Follow the directions on the medicine label carefully - If you don\u2019t understand the directions, ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist to explain them to you - Keep a list of all the medicines, vitamins, minerals, and herbs you use \u2014 and share this information with your doctor at your next checkup - Store your medicines in a cool, dry place where children and pets can\u2019t see or reach them\n\n### Types of Medicines\n\nThe 2 types of medicine are prescription and over-the-counter (OTC).\n\n#### Prescription medicines\n\nPrescription medicines are medicines you can get only with a prescription (order) from your doctor. You get these medicines from a pharmacy.\n\nThese medicines are only safe to use if your name is on the prescription. Using someone else\u2019s prescription medicine can be very harmful.\n\nSometimes you can choose between a generic medicine and a brand name medicine. Generic and brand name medicines work the same way, but generic medicine usually costs less.\n\nTalk to your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company for more information about generic medicines. [You can also read more about generic medicines](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/QuestionsAnswers/ucm100100.htm).\n\n#### Over-the-Counter Medicines\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are medicines you can buy at a store without a prescription.\n\nSome examples of OTC medicines include:\n\n- Cold and flu medicines - Pain medicines like aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen - Allergy medicines - Sleep aids - Toothpaste with fluoride\n\n##### Read your medicine's Drug Facts label.\n\nAll OTC medicines come with a Drug Facts label.

OTC medicines can cause side effects or harm if you use too much or don\u2019t use them correctly.\n\nFollowing the directions on the Drug Facts label will lower your chances of side effects. [Learn more about what\u2019s on the Drug Facts label](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/understanding-over-counter-medicines/over-counter-drug-facts-label).\n\nYour doctor, nurse, or pharmacist can also help you choose OTC medicines and answer any questions you may have\n\n[Take Action](#)\n\n## Take Action\n\n### Talk to Your Doctor\n\nTake these steps to prevent problems and mistakes with your medicines.\n\n#### Talk to your doctor before starting a new medicine.\n\nBefore you use any new prescription medicines, tell your doctor:\n\n- About other medicines you use \u2014 both prescription and OTC medicines - About any vitamins, minerals, or herbs you use - If you're allergic to any medicines - If you\u2019ve had side effects after using any medicines - If you're pregnant or breastfeeding \u2014 this is because some medicines may harm your baby - If you have any questions or concerns about the new medicine\n\nBe sure to keep taking your prescription medicines until your doctor tells you it\u2019s okay to stop \u2014 even if you\u2019re feeling better. If you're worried the medicine is making you feel worse, tell your doctor. Keep in mind that sometimes you can get side effects when you stop your medicine.\n\n#### Talk with your doctor about drug misuse.\n\nIf you think you may have a problem with either legal medicines or illegal drugs (like heroin or cocaine), tell your doctor. Your doctor needs to know what drugs you\u2019re using before you start a new medicine \u2014 and treatment can help you stop misusing drugs.[Learn more about getting help for drug misuse](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/topics/talk-your-doctor-about-drug-misuse).\n\n### Take Time to Understand Directions\n\n#### Follow the directions carefully.\n\nBe sure to read the directions carefully when taking prescription or OTC medicines.

Take notes to help you remember the answers. You can even ask to record the instructions on your phone. [Check out these questions to ask your doctor or nurse](https://www.ahrq.gov/questions/be-engaged/index.html).\n\nYou can also ask a pharmacist if you forget how to use a medicine or you don\u2019t understand the directions.

If they look different when you get a refill, ask your pharmacist to double-check that you have the right medicine.\n\n### Keep Them Safe\n\n#### Put your medicines in a safe place.\n\nYour medicines will last longer and work better if you store them correctly. Follow these tips:\n\n- Check for storage instructions on the medicine label \u2014 for example, some medicines need to be stored in the refrigerator. - Store medicines that don't have special storage instructions in a cool, dry place. Medicines can go bad in places that are damp and warm, like the kitchen or bathroom. - Keep medicines away from children and pets. Using a locked box, cabinet, or closet is best.

The risks of medicines are the chances that something unwanted or unexpected could happen to you when you use them. Risks could be less serious things, such as an upset stomach, or more serious things, such as liver damage. Here are some tips from the Food and Drug Administration and some of its public health partners to help you weigh the risks and benefits when you make decisions about the medicines you use.\n\n#### Managing Risk\n\nWhen a medicine's benefits outweigh its known risks, the FDA considers it safe enough to approve. But before using any medicine--as with many things that you do every day--you should think through the benefits and the risks in order to make the best choice for you.\n\nThere are several types of risks from medicine use:\n\n- The possibility of a harmful interaction between the medicine and a food, beverage, dietary supplement (including vitamins and herbals), or another medicine. Combinations of any of these products could increase the chance that there may be interactions. - The chance that the medicine may not work as expected. - The possibility that the medicine may cause additional problems.\n\nFor example, every time you get into a car, there are risks. You could have an accident, causing costly damage to your car, or injury to yourself or a loved one. But there are also benefits to riding in a car: You can travel farther and faster than walking, bring home more groceries from the store, and travel in cold or wet weather in greater comfort.\n\nTo obtain the benefits of riding in a car, you think through the risks. You consider the condition of your car and the road, for instance, before deciding to make that trip to the store.\n\nThe same is true before using any medicine. Every choice to take a medicine involves thinking through the helpful effects as well as the possible unwanted effects.\n\nHere are some specific ways to lower the risks and obtain the full benefits of medicines:\n\n#### Talk With Your Doctor, Pharmacist, or Other Health Care Professionals\n\n- Keep an up-to-date, written list of all the medicines (prescription and over-the-counter) and dietary supplements, including vitamins and herbals, that you use--even those you only use occasionally. - Share this list with all of your health care professionals. - Tell them about any allergies or sensitivities that you may have. - Tell them about anything that could affect your ability to take medicines, such as difficulty swallowing or remembering to take them. - Tell them if you are or might become pregnant, or if you are nursing a baby. - Always ask your health care professional questions about any concerns or thoughts that you may have.\n\n#### Know Your Medicines--Prescription and Over-the-Counter\n\n- the brand and generic names - what they look like - how to store them properly - when, how, and how long to use them - how and under what conditions you should stop using them - what to do if you miss a dose - what they are supposed to do and when to expect results - side effects and interactions - whether you need any tests or monitoring - always ask for written information to take with you.\n\n#### Read the Label and Follow Directions\n\n- Make sure you understand the directions; ask if you have questions or concerns. - Always double-check that you have the right medicine. - Keep medicines in their original labeled containers, whenever possible. - Never combine different medicines in the same bottle. - Read and follow the directions on the label and the directions from your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. If you stop the medicine or want to use the medicine differently than directed, consult with your health care professional.\n\n#### Avoid Interactions\n\n- Ask whether there are interactions with any other medicines or dietary supplements (including vitamins or herbal supplements), beverages, or foods. - Use the same pharmacy for all of your medicine needs, whenever possible. - Before starting any new medicine or dietary supplement (including vitamins or herbal supplements), ask again whether there are possible interactions with what you are currently using.\n\n#### Monitor Your Medicines' Effects--And the Effects of Other Products That You Use\n\n- Ask whether there is anything you can do to minimize side effects, such as eating before you take a medicine to reduce stomach upset. - Pay attention to how you are feeling; note any changes. Write down the changes so that you can remember to tell your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professional. - Know what to do if you experience side effects and when to notify your doctor. - Know when you should notice an improvement and when to report back.\n\n#### Weighing the Risks, Making the Choice\n\nThe benefit-risk decision is sometimes difficult to make. The best choice depends on your particular situation.\n\nYou must decide what risks you can and will accept in order to get the benefits you want. For example, if facing a life-threatening illness, you might choose to accept more risk in the hope of getting the benefits of a cure or living a longer life. On the other hand, if you are facing a minor illness, you might decide that you want to take very little risk. In many situations, the expert advice of your doctor, pharmacist, or other health care professionals can help you make the decision.\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET\n\nBEGIN QUALTRICS WEBSITE FEEDBACK SNIPPET"

Older adults often have multiple medical conditions and may take many medicines, which puts them at additional risk for negative side effects. Read on to learn how to safely take and keep track of all your medicines.\n\n## What are medicines?\n\nMedicines, often referred to as drugs, are used to prevent or treat diseases and other health conditions. Medicines can be obtained by a prescription or over the counter (OTC). Prescription drugs are medicines that you can get only with a doctor\u2019s order; for example, pills to lower your cholesterol or an asthma inhaler. OTC medications can be purchased without a prescription; for example, aspirin or lubricating eye drops.\n\nDietary supplements are not considered drugs because they are not intended to prevent or treat diseases. Rather, these products are intended to maintain or improve health, and they may help you meet your daily requirements for essential vitamins and minerals. For example, calcium and vitamin D can help build strong bones. Learn more about taking supplements safely in the NIA article, Dietary Supplements for Older Adults.\n\nIt can be dangerous to combine certain prescription drugs, OTC medicines, dietary supplements, or other remedies. For example, you should not take aspirin if you take warfarin for heart problems. To avoid potentially serious health issues, talk to your doctor about all medicines you take, including those prescribed by other doctors, and any OTC drugs, vitamins, supplements, and herbal remedies. Mention everything, even ones you use infrequently.\n\n## Starting a new medicine\n\nTalk with your health care provider before starting any new prescription, OTC medicine, or supplement, and ensure that your provider knows everything else you are taking. Discuss any allergies or problems you have experienced with other medicines. These might include rashes, trouble breathing, indigestion, dizziness, or mood changes. Make sure your doctor and pharmacist have an up-to-date list of your allergies so they don\u2019t give you a medicine that contains something that could cause an allergic reaction.\n\nYou will also want to find out whether you\u2019ll need to change or stop taking any of your other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements while using this new medicine. Mixing a new drug with medicines or supplements you are already taking might cause unpleasant and sometimes serious problems. For example, mixing a drug you take to help you sleep (a sedative) and a drug you take for allergies (an antihistamine) can slow your reactions and make driving a car or operating machinery dangerous.\n\nWhen starting a new medication, be sure to write down the name of the drug, the dose, and why it\u2019s being prescribed for you. Also, make note of any special instructions for how to take the medicine. For many drugs, this information is included on the bottle or prescription label.\n\n- Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine Before you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.Ask your doctor:What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?Is there a less expensive alternative?What medical condition does this medicine treat?When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?What type of side effects might I expect, if any? What should I do if I experience serious side effects?Will this drug cause problems if I am taking other prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements?What should I do if I want to stop taking this medicine? Is it safe to stop abruptly?Will I need a refill? If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?Ask your pharmacist:Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?How much medicine should I take?How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?Each time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.Find more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n### Questions to ask your health care provider about a new medicine\n\nBefore you start a new medicine, your doctor or pharmacist can provide important information and answer any questions.\n\nAsk your doctor:\n\n- What is the name of the medicine and why am I taking it?\n\n- Is there a less expensive alternative?\n\n- What medical condition does this medicine treat?\n\n- When should I expect the medicine to start working? How will I know if it\u2019s working?\n\n- What type of side effects might I expect, if any?

If so, will I need a follow-up appointment or other testing before I can refill the medication?\n\nAsk your pharmacist:\n\n- Is it safe for me to drive while taking this medication?\n\n- Should I take the medicine with food or not? Is there anything I should not eat or drink when taking this medicine?\n\n- How much medicine should I take?\n\n- How many times a day should I take it? At what time(s)? If the bottle says take \u201cfour times a day,\u201d does that mean four times in 24 hours or four times when I am awake?\n\n- What does \u201cas needed\u201d mean?\n\n- If I forget to take my medicine, what should I do?\n\nEach time you visit one of your health care providers, tell them about any new prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you\u2019re taking and be sure to ask if you still need to be on all your medications.\n\nFind more resources for communicating with your health care team about medications.\n\n## Filling your prescription\n\nWhen you get your prescriptions filled, the pharmacist can answer many of your questions about prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements. Try to have all your prescriptions filled at the same pharmacy so your records are in one place. This will help alert the pharmacist if a new drug might cause a problem with something else you\u2019re taking. If you\u2019re unable to use just one pharmacy, share your list of medicines and supplements with the pharmacist at each location when you drop off your prescription.\n\nWhen you have a prescription filled:\n\n- Ask your pharmacist if there is a patient profile you can fill out, so the pharmacy is aware of all drugs and OTC medications, vitamins, and supplements you take.\n\n- Tell the pharmacist if you have trouble swallowing pills. There may be liquid medicine available. Do not chew, break, or crush tablets without first asking if this will change the way the drug works.\n\n- Make sure you can read and understand the name of the medicine as well as the directions on the container and on the color-coded warning stickers on the bottle. If the label is hard to read, ask your pharmacist to use larger type.\n\n- Read all the information about your medication carefully. Many prescription medicines come with paper handouts, called medication guides, that contain information to help patients avoid serious side effects.\n\n- Check that you can open the container. If not, ask the pharmacist to put your medicines in bottles that are easier to open.\n\n- Ask about special instructions on where to store a medicine. For example, should it be kept in the refrigerator or in another climate-controlled place?\n\n- Check the label on your medicine before leaving the pharmacy. It should have your name on it and the directions provided by your doctor. If it doesn\u2019t, don\u2019t take it, and talk with the pharmacist.\n\nThe image below points out information typically present on a prescription label. Please note that your prescription label may have a different format than the one shown. The prescription number is usually printed in the upper left corner of the label.\n\nTalk with your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions about the written information that comes with your prescription.\n\n- Medications and traveling When you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about these changes before you depart. Carry a list of all the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take and the phone numbers of your doctors and pharmacists. When flying, carry your medicines with you; do not pack them in your checked luggage. Take enough medication with you in case you need to stay longer. Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n### Medications and traveling\n\nWhen you travel, your health care provider may recommend that you adjust your medicine schedule to account for changes in time zones, routine, and diet.

Always keep medicines out of heat and direct sunlight both at home and when traveling.\n\n## Medication side effects\n\nUnwanted or unexpected symptoms or feelings that occur when you take medicine are called side effects. Side effects can be relatively minor, such as a headache or a dry mouth. They can also be life-threatening, such as severe bleeding or damage to the liver or kidneys. The side effects of some medications can also affect your driving.\n\nSome side effects may appear when you start taking a medicine but get better with time. Others occur once in a while. But some side effects may be ongoing while you\u2019re on the medication. If you have uncomfortable side effects, don\u2019t stop taking your medicine before you talk with a health care provider. Write them down so you can report them to your doctor or pharmacist accurately. Call your doctor right away if you have any problems with your medicines or if you are worried that the medicine might be doing more harm than good. Your health care provider may be able to prescribe a different medicine or help you deal with side effects in other ways.\n\n- Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference? A generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug. Generic drugs and their brand-name equivalents contain the same active ingredients, which are the parts of the medicine that make it work. A generic drug is just as safe, and is of equal strength and quality, as a brand-name drug. You take a generic drug the same way as a brand-name drug. Generic drugs are usually less expensive than their brand-name counterparts, and they are more likely to be covered by health insurance.\n\n### Generic or brand name: What\u2019s the difference?\n\nA generic drug is a medication created to work the same way and have the same effects as an already marketed brand-name drug.

Here are some tips that can help:\n\n- Make a list. Write down all medicines you take, including OTC drugs. Also include any vitamins or dietary supplements. The list should include the name of each medicine or supplement, the amount you take, and time(s) you take it. If it\u2019s a prescription drug, also note the doctor who prescribed it and the reason it was prescribed. Show the list to all your health care providers, including physical therapists and dentists. Keep one copy in a safe place at home and one in your wallet or purse.\n\n- Get familiar with your medicines. If you take more than one medicine, make sure you can tell them apart by size, shape, color, or the number imprinted on the pill.\n\n- Create a file. Save all the written information that comes with your medicines and keep it somewhere you can easily refer to it. Keep these guides for as long as you\u2019re taking the medication.\n\n- Check expiration dates on bottles. Don\u2019t take medicines that are past their expiration date. Your doctor can tell you if you need a refill.\n\n- Secure your medicines. Keep your medicines out of the reach of children and pets. If you take any prescription pain medicines (for example, morphine, other opioids, or codeine), keep them in a locked cabinet or drawer. If your medicines are kept in bottles without safety caps because those are hard for you to open, be extra careful about where you store them.\n\n- Dispose of your medicines safely. Check the expiration dates on your medication bottles and discard any unused or expired medicines as soon as possible. Timely disposal of medicines can reduce the risk of others taking them accidentally or misusing the medications on purpose. Check with your doctor or pharmacist about how to safely discard expired or unneeded medications, or review the FDA\u2019s guidance on Where and How To Dispose of Unused Medicines.\n\nGet more tips for managing your medications.\n\n- Do I need to take so many medications? The use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults. People age 65 and older tend to take more medicines than those in any other age group, often because they have several diseases or other health problems at the same time. Managing multiple medications can be expensive and difficult to track, especially for those who are homebound or who live in rural areas. Check out these tips for taking multiple medications safely.Taking many medications can also increase the risk for side effects and other unintended problems. Researchers are studying deprescribing, an approach to safely reduce or stop medications that are potentially inappropriate or unnecessary. Read how NIA supports research on polypharmacy and deprescribing to help ensure older adults take only those medicines they need to help them live full, healthy lives.If you are concerned that you might be taking too many medications, have a conversation with your health care provider about whether there are any you could safely reduce or stop.\n\n### Do I need to take so many medications?\n\nThe use of multiple drugs to treat diseases and other health conditions \u2014 called polypharmacy \u2014 is a growing concern for older adults.

Read all medicine labels and be sure to follow instructions. Don\u2019t take a larger dose of a medicine, thinking it will help you more. This could be very dangerous and even deadly. And don\u2019t skip or take half doses of a prescription drug to save money.\n\n- Take medicine on time. Some people use meals or bedtime as reminders to take their medicine. Other people use charts, calendars, or weekly pill boxes. You can also set timers and write reminders to take your medication. Medication reminder apps for smartphones are becoming more popular; these apps can help you remember when and how to take your medications each day.\n\n- Turn on a light. Don\u2019t take medicine in the dark; you might make a mistake.\n\n- Report problems. Call your doctor right away if you have any trouble with your prescriptions, OTC medicines, or supplements. There may be something else you can take.\n\n- Tell your doctor about alcohol, tobacco, and drug use. Alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs can affect how well your medicines work. Be honest with your doctor about how much you use.\n\n- Ask your loved ones for help. Take a friend or relative with you to your doctor\u2019s appointments if you think you may need help understanding or remembering what the doctor tells you.\n\n- Check before stopping. Take prescription medicine until it\u2019s finished, or your doctor says it\u2019s all right to stop. Note that some medicines are supposed to be taken only \u201cas needed.\u201d\n\n- Don\u2019t share. Do not take medicines prescribed for another person or give yours to someone else.\n\n### Can I get addicted to pain medicine?\n\n## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)\n\nWhy is a medicine I've taken for years no longer working?\n\nAs you age, changes in your body can affect how well medicines work. For example, the body may become less able to absorb the medicine. Older adults often have multiple medical conditions or take several medications at the same time, which can also affect how medicines work. And as an illness worsens, the medicines used to treat it might not be as effective as they once were. Talk to your doctor if you think your medicine is not working as well as it should be.\n\nWhy do I need to pay attention to the active ingredients in my medications?\n\nLearn which active ingredients are in the prescription drugs, OTC medicines, and supplements you take so that you don\u2019t take more than one that contains the same active ingredient. For example, if your cough syrup contains acetaminophen, don\u2019t take it at the same time as a pain reliever that also contains that ingredient. Taking more than one medication or supplement with the same active ingredient could damage your liver or lead to other serious health problems.\n\nWhat do the abbreviations in my prescription mean?\n\nDoctors and pharmacists often use abbreviations or terms that may not be familiar to you. Here is an explanation of some of the most common abbreviations you will see on labels of your prescription medications:\n\n- Rx means \u201cprescription\u201d\n\n- prn means \u201cas needed\u201d\n\n- qd means \u201cevery day,\u201d bid means \u201ctwice a day,\u201d tid means \u201cthree times a day,\u201d qid means \u201cfour times a day\u201d\n\n- ac means \u201cbefore meals,\u201d pc means \u201cafter meals\u201d\n\n- hs means \u201cat bedtime\u201d\n\n- po means \u201cby mouth\u201d\n\n- ea means \u201ceach\u201d\n\nAsk your pharmacist to explain any terms or abbreviations on your prescription medication label that you don\u2019t understand.\n\nWhat does it mean to take medicines on an empty stomach?\n\nSome medications need to be taken when your stomach is empty because food or drink can affect how they work. Taking medicines on an empty stomach generally means that you should take your pills at least two hours before you eat or two hours after you eat. However, this is only a rough guideline. Be sure to follow the instructions from your pharmacist about exactly when to take your medications.\n\nIs it okay to stop taking my medicine if I start to feel better?\n\nNo. Even if you are feeling better, you should not stop taking your prescription drug unless your doctor says it\u2019s okay. If you stop taking your medicine before you are supposed to, you may not get its full effect, or your condition could worsen. Some medicines need to be stopped slowly, and others (such as antibiotics) need to be taken until they are gone. Talk with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure about when you can stop taking a medication.\n\nAre there ways to save money on medicines?\n\nMedicines can be costly. Even with private health insurance or Medicare, people may have to pay part of the costs for prescription medications themselves. If you have limited resources, help may be available. First, tell your doctor if you\u2019re worried about paying for medications. They may have suggestions or resources to share.\n\nHere are some other ideas that could help:\n\n- Consider a generic version of the drug. Ask your doctor whether a generic drug or a less expensive brand-name medicine is available.\n\n- Shop around to find the best prices. You can compare costs from neighborhood pharmacies, mail-order services, and legitimate online pharmacies.\n\n- Look for discount programs. Savings programs are offered by some retail pharmacies, drug companies, and nonprofit organizations. Some states also have drug assistance programs. Medicare.gov offers a searchable list of pharmaceutical assistance programs for specific drugs.\n\n- Learn about the Medicare Extra Help Program. People with financial hardship who receive Medicare drug benefits may qualify for this program to help cover medication costs.\n\nIs it safe to order prescription medicines online?\n\nBe careful if you\u2019re thinking about buying prescription medications online to save money. Medicines from a fake online pharmacy can be ineffective, unsafe, or even dangerous. It\u2019s important to order from a website that\u2019s safe: Many are not, and it can be hard to determine which ones are reliable. Make sure that an online pharmacy requires a valid prescription, is licensed in your state, and has a pharmacist available to answer questions.\n\n### You may also be interested in\n\n- Ordering or downloading tips for taking medicines safely as you age\n\n- Learning about managing medicines for a person with Alzheimer\u2019s disease\n\n- Downloading a worksheet for managing medications and supplements\n\nMedicare 800-633-4227 877-486-2048 (TTY) www.cms.gov www.medicare.gov\n\nEldercare Locator 800-677-1116 eldercarelocator@USAging.org https://eldercare.acl.gov\n\nNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health888-644-6226info@nccih.nih.govwww.nccih.nih.gov\n\nU.S. Food and Drug Administration Information for Consumers and Patients 855-543-3784 www.fda.gov/drugs/resources-you-drugs/information-consumers-and-patients-drugs\n\nThis content is provided by the NIH National Institute on Aging (NIA).

                "content": "Using over-the-counter medicines safely\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) medicines are those you can buy without a prescription. They treat a variety of minor health conditions. Most OTC medicines are not as strong as what you can get with a prescription. But that does not mean they are without risk. In fact, not using the OTC medicines safely can lead to serious health problems.Here is what you need to know about OTC medicines.\n\n## About OTC Medicines\n\nYou can buy OTC medicines without a prescription in:\n\n- Drug stores - Grocery stores - Discount and department stores - Convenience stores - Some gas stations\n\nWhen used properly, OTC medicines can help protect your health by:\n\n- Relieving symptoms such as pain, coughing, or diarrhea - Preventing or treating problems like heartburn or motion sickness - Treating conditions such as athlete's foot, allergies, or headaches - Providing first aid\n\n## When Should you use OTC Medicines\n\nIt is fine to use OTC medicines for most minor health problems or illnesses. If you are not sure, ask your health care provider or your pharmacist. Your provider can tell you:\n\n- Whether an OTC medicine is right for your condition - How the medicine might interact with other medicines you take - What side effects or problems to watch for\n\nYour pharmacist can answer questions such as:\n\n- What the medicine will do - How it should be stored - Whether another medicine might work as well or better\n\n## What the Label can Tell you\n\nYou can also get information about OTC medicines on the medicine label.\n\nMost OTC medicines have the same kind of label, and soon all of them will. That means whether you buy a box of cough drops or a bottle of aspirin you will always know where to find information you need.\n\nHere is what the label will show you:\n\n- **Active Ingredient.** This tells you the name of the medicine you are taking and how much is in each dose. - **Uses.** The conditions and symptoms the medicine can treat are listed here. Unless your provider tells you otherwise, do not use the medicine for any condition not listed. - **Warnings.** Pay close attention to this section. It tells you if you should talk with your provider before taking the medicine. For instance, you should not take certain antihistamines if you have a breathing problem like emphysema. The warnings also tell you about side effects and interactions. You should not take some medicines when using alcohol or taking other medicines. The label will also tell you what to do in case of an overdose. - **Directions.** The label tells you how much medicine to take at one time, how often to take it, and how much is safe to take. This information is broken down by age group. Read the directions fully, because the dosage may be different for people of different ages. - **Other Information.** This includes such things as how to store the medicine. - **Inactive Ingredients.** Inactive means the ingredients should not have an effect on your body. Read them anyway so you know what you are taking.\n\nThe label will also tell you the medicine's expiration date. You should dispose of it and not take it once that date has passed.\n\n## Other Ways to use OTC Medicines Safely\n\nYou should:\n\n- Examine the package before you buy it. Make sure it has not been tampered with. - Never use medicine you have bought that does not look the way you think it should or that is in a package that appears suspicious. Return it to the place from which you bought it. - Never take medicine in the dark or without glasses if you are unable to see clearly. Always be sure you are taking the right medicine from the right container. - Always tell your provider what medicines you take. This includes prescription and OTC medicines as well as herbals and supplements. Some prescription medicines will interact with OTC medicines. And some contain the same ingredients as OTC medicines, which means you could end up taking more than you should.\n\nAlso be sure to take steps to [keep kids safe](https://medlineplus.gov/patientinstructions/000619.htm). You can prevent accidents by keeping medicine locked up, out of reach, and out of sight of children.\n\n## Alternative Names\n\nOTC - using safely\n\n## References\n\nUS Food & Drug Administration website.

                "content": "Key points\n\n- Medicines are safe when used as prescribed or as directed on the label. There are risks in taking any medicine, vitamin or other supplement. - An adverse drug event (ADE) is when a medication causes harm to someone. ADEs include allergic reactions, side effects, overmedication and medication errors. They are a serious public health threat. - ADEs are a preventable patient safety problem.\n\n## Why it's important\n\nThe number of ADEs can increase due to:\n\n- Development and use of new medicines. - Discovery of new uses for older medicines. - The aging American population. - Increased use of medicines for disease treatment and prevention.\n\nLearning about medication safety can reduce the risk of harm for you and your loved ones.\n\n### More than 1.5 million emergency visits\u200e\u200e\n\nEach year in the United States, ADEs cause more than one and a half million visits to hospital emergency departments.\n\n## Tips\n\nPractice medication safety at home\n\n### Adults\n\n#### Keep a list\n\n- Keep a list of your medicines, vitamins, and other supplements. - Make sure your doctor knows about all the medicines, vitamins and other supplements you take.\n\n#### Follow label directions\n\n- Take medicines as directed on the label or as instructed by a doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Take medicine on time\n\n- Some medicines should be taken with meals or during a certain time of day (e.g., bedtime). - Set timers or reminders to help you remember to take your medicines. You might try a reminder app.\n\n#### Turn a light on\n\n- Turn on a light when taking medicines so you don't misread the label and make a mistake. - If you wear eyeglasses, put them on as well.\n\n#### Ask questions\n\n- If you do not understand label instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before taking the medicine.\n\n#### Get the tests you need\n\n- Keep up with any blood testing suggested by your doctor.\n\n### Children\n\n#### Know the dose.\n\nAlways:\n\n- Read the label. - Follow directions. - Measure your child's dose using the dosing device (oral syringe, dosing cup) that comes with the medicine. Do not give a child more medicine than stated on the package.\n\n#### Check the label\n\n- Check the active ingredients in prescription and over-the-counter medicines. - Make sure that you do not give your child two medicines that have the same active ingredient. - If you have questions, ask your doctor or pharmacist.\n\n#### Use the right tool\n\n- If you do not have a dosing device, ask your pharmacist for one. - Do not use household spoons to give medicines to children.\n\n#### Get questions answered\n\n- If you do not understand the instructions, talk to your pharmacist or doctor before giving the medicine.\n\n#### Teach children\n\n- Teach your children what medicine is and why you or a trusted adult must give it to them.\n\n#### Lock the safety cap\n\n- Always check that the cap on a medicine bottle is locked.\n\n#### Put medicines away\n\n- After locking the safety cap, always put medicines back in their safe storage location. - Keep medicines in a place young children cannot reach or see.\n\n## What CDC is doing\n\n- Monitoring ADEs across the country and using these data to improve medication safety through key partnerships and enhanced policies. - Reducing ADEs by focusing on specific medications and high-risk groups. - Promoting ADE awareness through nationwide educational campaigns.\n\n##### Get email updates\n\nStay up-to-date with the latest medication safety information\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Drug Information for Consumers](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/default.htm), FDA - [Buying & Using Medicine Safely](http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/default.htm), FDA - [Disposal of Unused Medicines: What You Should Know](https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/Consumers/BuyingUsingMedicineSafely/EnsuringSafeUseofMedicine/SafeDisposalofMedicines/ucm186187.htm), FDA - [Taking Medicines,](https://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/diagnosis-treatment/treatments/index.html) Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) - [Drug Safety](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/drugsafety.html), National Institutes of Health (NIH) - [Medication Without Harm, World Health Organization (WHO](https://www.who.int/initiatives/medication-without-harm)) - [Safe Medication](http://www.safemedication.com/), American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) - [ConsumerMedSafety.org](http://www.consumermedsafety.org/), Institute for Medication Safety Practices (ISMP) - [Consumer Information for Safe Mediation Use](http://www.nccmerp.org/consumer-information), National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) - [Health In Hand, CHPA Educational Foundation](https://www.healthinhand.org/)\n\nNovember 18, 2024\n\nSources Print Share Content Source: National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID)\n\n## Medication Safety"

Closely monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for clinical worsening, and for emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Citalopram is not approved for use in pediatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ].\n\n## 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE\nCitalopram tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in adults [see Clinical Studies (14) ] .\n\n## 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION\n- Administer once daily with or without food ( 2 ) .\n- Initial dosage is 20 mg once daily; after one week may increase to maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily ( 2.1 ).\n- Patients greater than 60 years of age, patients with hepatic impairment, and CYP2C19 poor metabolizers: maximum recommended dosage is 20 mg once daily ( 2.2 ).\n- When discontinuing citalopram tablets, reduce dosage gradually ( 2.4 , 5.6 ).\n\n## 2.1 Recommended Dosage\nAdminister citalopram tablets once daily, with or without food, at an initial dosage of 20 mg once daily, with an increase to a maximum dosage of 40 mg once daily at an interval of no less than one week.\n\nDosages above 40 mg once daily are not recommended due to the risk of QT prolongation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS\nCitalopram tablets, USP are available as:\n\n40 mg: White colored, biconvex, capsule shaped film coated tablets debossed with \u2018A\u2019 on one side and with a score line in between \u20180\u2019 and \u20187\u2019 on other side\n\n## 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS\nCitalopram tablets are contraindicated in patients:\n\n- taking, or within 14 days of stopping, MAOIs (including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue) because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- taking pimozide because of risk of QT prolongation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n- with known hypersensitivity to citalopram or any of the inactive ingredients in citalopram tablets. Reactions have included angioedema and anaphylaxis [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ].\n\n## 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS\n- QT-Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes : \u00a0Dose-dependent QTc prolongation, Torsade de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death have occurred. Avoid use of citalopram in patients with congenital long QT syndrome, bradycardia, hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, recent acute myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure and patients taking other drugs that prolong the QTc interval. Monitor electrolytes in patients at high risk for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. Discontinue citalopram in patients with persistent QTc measurements > 500 ms ( 5.2 , 7 ) .\n- Serotonin Syndrome : \u00a0Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue citalopram and serotonergic agents and\u00a0initiate supportive measures ( 5.3 ) .\n- Increased Risk of Bleeding :\u00a0Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin and other anticoagulants may increase this risk ( 5.4 ) .\n- Activation of Mania/Hypomania :\u00a0Screen patients for bipolar disorder ( 5.5 ) .\n- Seizures :\u00a0Use with caution in patients with seizure disorder ( 5.7 ).\n- Angle-Closure Glaucoma :\u00a0Avoid use of citalopram in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles ( 5.8 ) .\n- Hyponatremia :\u00a0Can occur in association with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion ( 5.9 ) .\n- Sexual Dysfunction :\u00a0Citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.10 ) .\n\n## 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS\nThe following adverse reactions are discussed in greater detail in other sections of the labeling:\n\n- Hypersensitivity reactions [see Contraindications (4) ]\n- Suicidal thoughts and behaviors in adolescents and young adults [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]\n- QT-prolongation and torsade de pointes [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]\n- Serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]\n- Increased risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]\n- Activation of mania or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]\n- Discontinuation syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]\n- Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]\n- Angle-closure glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]\n- Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]\n- Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]\n\n## 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS\nTable 5 presents clinically important drug interactions with citalopram.\n\nTable: Table 5: Clinically Important Drug Interactions with Citalopram | Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) | Clinical Impact | Concomitant use of SSRIs, including citalopram, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.5) | , | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.3) | ] | . | Pimozide | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with pimozide increases plasma concentrations of pimozide, a drug with a narrow therapeutic index, and may increase the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong QT can cause additional QT prolongation compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | Avoid concomitant use of citalopram with drugs that prolong the QT interval (citalopram is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide) | [see | Contraindications (4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | CYP2C19 Inhibitors | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram with CYP2C19 inhibitors increases the risk of QT prolongation and/or ventricular arrhythmias compared to the use of citalopram alone | [see | Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) | ]. | Intervention: | The maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 20 mg daily when used concomitantly with a CYP2C19 inhibitor | [see | Dosage and Administration (2.4) | , | Warnings and Precautions (5.2) | ]. | Other Serotonergic Drugs | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and other serotonergic drugs (including other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, buspirone, amphetamines, tryptophan, and St. John's Wort) increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. | Intervention: | Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during citalopram initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of citalopram and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.3) | ]. | Drugs That Interfere With Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) | Clinical Impact: | Concomitant use of citalopram and an antiplatelet or anticoagulant may potentiate the risk of bleeding. | Intervention: | Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of citalopram and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio | [see | Warning and Precautions (5.4) | ].\n\n## 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS\n- Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly late in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulties, hypotonia, tremor, irritability) in the neonate ( 8.1 ) .\n\n## 8.1 Pregnancy\nPregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to advise patients to register by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-844-405-6185 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/research/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Clinical Considerations]. Available data from published epidemiologic studies and postmarketing reports with citalopram use in pregnancy have not established an increased risk of major birth defects or miscarriage. Published studies demonstrated that citalopram levels in both cord blood and amniotic fluid are similar to those observed in maternal serum. There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including citalopram, during pregnancy . There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations) .\n\nIn animal reproduction studies, citalopram caused adverse embryo/fetal effects at doses that caused maternal toxicity (see Data) .\n\nThe estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in the clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nDisease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk\n\nWomen who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risk of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of citalopram in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions\n\nNeonates exposed to citalopram and other SSRIs late in third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .\n\nData\n\nHuman Data\n\nExposure during late pregnancy to SSRIs may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.\n\nAnimal Data\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during the period of organogenesis at doses of 32, 56, and 112 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 8, 14, and 27 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram caused maternal toxicity of CNS clinical signs and decreased weight gain at 112 mg/kg/day, which is 27 times the MRHD. At this maternally toxic dose, citalopram decreased embryo/fetal growth and survival and increased fetal abnormalities (including cardiovascular and skeletal defects). The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 56 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 14 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. No maternal or embryofetal toxicity was observed. The NOAEL for maternal and embryofetal toxicity is 16 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD.\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to pregnant rats during late gestation and lactation periods at doses of 4.8, 12.8, and 32 mg/kg/day, which are approximately 1, 3, and 8 times the MRHD of 40 mg, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Citalopram increased offspring mortality during the first 4 days of birth and decreased offspring growth at 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity is 12.8 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the MRHD. In a separate study, similar effects on offspring mortality and growth were seen when dams were treated throughout gestation and early lactation at doses \u2265 24 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 6 times the MRHD. A NOAEL was not determined in that study.\n\n## 8.2 Lactation\nRisk Summary\n\nData from the published literature report the presence of citalopram in human milk at relative infant doses ranging between 0.7 to 9.4% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.78 to 4.3. There are reports of breastfed infants exposed to citalopram experiencing irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss (see Clinical Considerations). There is no information about effects of citalopram on milk production.\n\nThe developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for citalopram and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from citalopram or from the underlying maternal condition.\n\nClinical Considerations\n\nMonitor breastfeeding infants for adverse reactions, such as irritability, restlessness, excessive somnolence, decreased feeding, and weight loss.\n\n## 8.4 Pediatric Use\nThe safety and effectiveness of citalopram have not been established in pediatric patients. Two placebo-controlled trials in 407 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with citalopram, and the data were not sufficient to support use in pediatric patients.\n\nAntidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs in pediatric patients.\n\n## 8.5 Geriatric Use\nOf 4422 patients in clinical studies of citalopram, 1357 were 60 and over, 1034 were 65 and over, and 457 were 75 and over. In two pharmacokinetic studies, citalopram AUC was increased by 23% and 30%, respectively, in subjects \u2265 60 years of age as compared to younger subjects, and its half-life was increased by 30% and 50%, respectively [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, the maximum recommended dosage in patients 60 years of age and older is lower than younger patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nSSRIs, including citalopram, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] .\n\n## 10 OVERDOSAGE\nThe following have been reported with citalopram tablet overdosage:\n\nProlonged cardiac monitoring is recommended in citalopram overdosage ingestions due to the arrhythmia risk. Gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal should be considered in patients who present early after a citalopram overdose. Consider contacting a Poison Center (1\u2010800\u2010221\u20102222) or a medical toxicologist for additional overdosage management recommendations.\n\n- Seizures, which may be delayed, and altered mental status including coma.\n- Cardiovascular toxicity, which may be delayed, including QRS and QTc interval prolongation, wide complex tachyarrhythmias, and torsade de pointes. Hypertension most commonly seen, but rarely can see hypotension alone or with co\u2010ingestants including alcohol.\n- Serotonin syndrome (patients with a multiple drug overdosage with other proserotonergic drugs may have a higher risk).\n\n## 11 DESCRIPTION\nCitalopram tablets, USP\u00a0contains citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Citalopram hydrobromide is a racemic bicyclic phthalane structure and is\u00a0designated (\u00b1)-1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile hydrobromide with the following structural formula:\n\nThe molecular formula is C 20 H 22 BrFN 2 O and its molecular weight is 405.35. Citalopram hydrobromide USP\u00a0occurs as a fine, white to off-white powder.\u00a0Citalopram hydrobromide is sparingly soluble in water and soluble in ethanol. Citalopram tablets, USP\u00a0are for oral administration and are available as film-coated round and capsule shaped tablets. The strengths reflect citalopram base equivalent content. The 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg strength tablets contain 12.49 mg, 24.98 mg, and 49.96 mg of citalopram hydrobromide, respectively. The 20 mg and 40 mg tablets are scored. Inactive ingredients: copovidone, corn starch, croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, hypromellose, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, and titanium dioxide.\u00a0 Iron oxides are used as coloring agents in the peach (10 mg) and light pink (20 mg) tablets.\n\n## 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.1 Mechanism of Action\nThe mechanism of action of citalopram is unclear, but is presumed to be related to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system (CNS) resulting from its inhibition of CNS neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT).\n\n## 12.2 Pharmacodynamics\nIn vitro and in vivo studies in animals suggest that citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) with minimal effects on norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) neuronal reuptake.\n\nCitalopram has no or very low affinity for 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , dopamine D 1 and D 2 , \u03b1 1 -, \u03b1 2 -, and \u03b2-adrenergic, histamine H 1 , gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), muscarinic cholinergic, and benzodiazepine receptors.\n\nCardiac Electrophysiology\n\nIndividually corrected QTc (QTcNi) interval was evaluated in a randomized, placebo and active (moxifloxacin 400 mg) controlled cross-over, escalating multiple-dose study in 119 healthy subjects. The maximum mean (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) difference from placebo were 8.5 (10.8) and 18.5 (21.0) msec for 20 mg and 60 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage) citalopram, respectively. Based on the established exposure-response relationship, the predicted QTcNi change from placebo (upper bound of the 95% one-sided confidence interval) under the C max for the dose of 40 mg is 12.6 (14.3) msec [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\n## 12.3 Pharmacokinetics\nThe single- and multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of citalopram are linear and dose-proportional in a dose range of 10 to 40 mg/day. Biotransformation of citalopram is mainly hepatic, with a mean terminal half-life of about 35 hours. With once daily dosing, steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week. At steady state, the extent of accumulation of citalopram in plasma, based on the half-life, is expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.\n\nAbsorption\n\nFollowing a single oral dose (40 mg tablet) of citalopram, peak blood levels occur at about 4 hours. The absolute bioavailability of citalopram was about 80% relative to an intravenous dose, and absorption is not affected by food.\n\nDistribution\n\nThe volume of distribution of citalopram is about 12 L/kg and the binding of citalopram (CT), demethylcitalopram (DCT) and didemethylcitalopram (DDCT) to human plasma proteins is about 80%.\n\nElimination\n\nMetabolism\n\nCitalopram is metabolized to demethylcitalopram (DCT), didemethylcitalopram (DDCT), citalopram-N-oxide, and a deaminated propionic acid derivative. In humans, unchanged citalopram is the predominant compound in plasma. At steady state, the concentrations of citalopram's metabolites, DCT and DDCT, in plasma are approximately one-half and one-tenth, respectively, that of the parent drug. In vitro studies show that citalopram is at least 8 times more potent than its metabolites in the inhibition of serotonin reuptake, suggesting that the metabolites evaluated do not likely contribute significantly to the antidepressant actions of citalopram.\n\nIn vitro studies using human liver microsomes indicated that CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary isozymes involved in the N-demethylation of citalopram.\n\nExcretion\n\nFollowing intravenous administrations of citalopram, the fraction of drug recovered in the urine as citalopram and DCT was about 10% and 5%, respectively. The systemic clearance of citalopram was 330 mL/min, with approximately 20% of that due to renal clearance.\n\nSpecific Populations\n\nGeriatric Patients\n\nCitalopram pharmacokinetics in subjects \u2265 60 years of age were compared to younger subjects in two normal volunteer studies. In a single-dose study, citalopram AUC and half-life were increased in the subjects \u2265 60 years old by 30% and 50%, respectively, whereas in a multiple-dose study they were increased by 23% and 30%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] .\n\nMale and Female Patients\n\nIn three pharmacokinetic studies (total N=32), citalopram AUC in women was one and a half to two times that in men. This difference was not observed in five other pharmacokinetic studies (total N=114). In clinical studies, no differences in steady state serum citalopram levels were seen between men (N=237) and women (N=388). There were no gender differences in the pharmacokinetics of DCT and DDCT.\n\nPatients with Hepatic Impairment\n\nCitalopram oral clearance was reduced by 37% and half-life was doubled in patients with reduced hepatic function compared to normal subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] .\n\nPatients with Renal Impairment\n\nIn patients with mild to moderate renal impairment, oral clearance of citalopram was reduced by 17% compared to normal subjects. No adjustment of dosage for such patients is recommended. No information is available about the pharmacokinetics of citalopram in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 20 mL/min).\n\nCYP2C19 poor metabolizers\n\nIn CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, citalopram steady state C max and AUC was increased by 68% and 107%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 poor metabolizers\n\nCitalopram steady state levels were not significantly different in poor metabolizers and extensive metabolizers of CYP2D6.\n\nDrug Interaction Studies\n\nIn vitro enzyme inhibition data did not reveal an inhibitory effect of citalopram on CYP3A4, -2C9, or -2E1, but did suggest that it is a weak inhibitor of CYP1A2, -2D6, and -2C19. Citalopram would be expected to have little inhibitory effect on in vivo metabolism mediated by these enzymes. However, in vivo data to address this question are limited.\n\nCYP3A4 and CYP2C19 Inhibitors\n\nSince CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 are the primary enzymes involved in the metabolism of citalopram, it is expected that potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, and macrolide antibiotics) and inhibitors of CYP2C19 (e.g., omeprazole, cimetidine) might decrease the clearance of citalopram. However, coadministration of citalopram and the potent CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram. 20 mg/day is the maximum recommended citalopram dose in patients taking concomitant cimetidine or another CYP2C19 inhibitor, because of the risk of QT prolongation [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nCimetidine\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of 400 mg twice a day cimetidine for 8 days resulted in an increase in citalopram AUC and C max of 43% and 39%, respectively [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nCYP2D6 Inhibitors\n\nCoadministration of a drug that inhibits CYP2D6 with citalopram is unlikely to have clinically significant effects on citalopram metabolism, based on the study results in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers.\n\nDigoxin\n\nIn subjects who had received 21 days of 40 mg/day citalopram, combined administration of citalopram and digoxin (single dose of 1 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or digoxin.\n\nLithium\n\nCoadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) and lithium (30 mmol/day for 5 days) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram or lithium.\n\nPimozide\n\nIn a controlled study, a single dose of pimozide 2 mg co-administered with citalopram 40 mg given once daily for 11 days was associated with a mean increase in QTc values of approximately 10 msec compared to pimozide given alone. Citalopram did not alter the mean AUC or C max of pimozide. The mechanism of this pharmacodynamic interaction is not known [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] .\n\nTheophylline\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 21 days) and the CYP1A2 substrate theophylline (single dose of 300 mg) did not affect the pharmacokinetics of theophylline. The effect of theophylline on the pharmacokinetics of citalopram was not evaluated.\n\nWarfarin\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 21 days did not affect the pharmacokinetics of warfarin, a CYP3A4 substrate. Prothrombin time was increased by 5%, the clinical significance of which is unknown.\n\nCarbamazepine\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 14 days) and carbamazepine (titrated to 400 mg/day for 35 days) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of carbamazepine, a CYP3A4 substrate. Although trough citalopram plasma levels were unaffected, given the enzyme-inducing properties of carbamazepine, the possibility that carbamazepine might increase the clearance of citalopram should be considered if the two drugs are coadministered.\n\nTriazolam\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (titrated to 40 mg/day for 28 days) and the CYP3A4 substrate triazolam (single dose of 0.25 mg) did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of either citalopram or triazolam.\n\nKetoconazole\n\nCombined administration of citalopram (40 mg) and ketoconazole (200 mg) decreased the C max and AUC of ketoconazole by 21% and 10%, respectively, and did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of citalopram.\n\nMetoprolol\n\nAdministration of 40 mg/day citalopram for 22 days resulted in a two-fold increase in the plasma levels of the beta-adrenergic blocker metoprolol. Increased metoprolol plasma levels have been associated with decreased cardioselectivity. Coadministration of citalopram and metoprolol had no clinically significant effects on blood pressure or heart rate.\n\nImipramine and Other Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs)\n\nIn vitro studies suggest that citalopram is a relatively weak inhibitor of CYP2D6. Coadministration of citalopram (40 mg/day for 10 days) with the TCA imipramine (single dose of 100 mg), a substrate for CYP2D6, did not significantly affect the plasma concentrations of imipramine or citalopram. However, the concentration of the imipramine metabolite desipramine was increased by approximately 50%. The clinical significance of the desipramine change is unknown.\n\n## 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Citalopram was not mutagenic in the in vitro mammalian forward gene mutation assay (HPRT) in mouse lymphoma cells or in in vitro/in vivo unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) assay in rat liver. It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility\nCarcinogenesis\n\nCitalopram increased the incidence of small intestine carcinoma in rats treated for 24 months at doses of 8 and 24 mg/kg/day in the diet, which are approximately 2 and 6 times the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 40 mg, respectively, based on mg/m 2 body surface area. A no-effect level (NOEL) for this finding was not established.\n\nCitalopram did not increase the incidence of tumors in mice treated for 18 months at doses up 240 mg/kg/day in the diet, which is approximately 30 times the MRDH of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area.\n\nMutagenesis\n\nCitalopram was mutagenic in the in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) in 2 of 5 bacterial strains (Salmonella TA98 and TA1537) in the absence of metabolic activation. It was clastogenic in the in vitro Chinese hamster lung cell assay for chromosomal aberrations in the presence and absence of metabolic activation.

It was not clastogenic in the in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human lymphocytes or in two in vivo mouse micronucleus assays.\n\nImpairment of Fertility\n\nCitalopram was administered orally to female and male rats at doses of 32, 48, and 72 mg/kg/day prior to and throughout mating and continuing to gestation. These doses are approximately 8, 12, and 17 times the MRHD of 40 mg based on mg/m 2 body surface area. Mating and fertility were decreased at doses \u2265 32 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 8 times the MRHD. Gestation duration was increased at 48 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 12 times the MRHD.\n\n## 14 CLINICAL STUDIES\nThe efficacy of citalopram as a treatment for major depressive disorder was established in two placebo-controlled studies (of 4 to 6 weeks duration) in adult outpatients (ages 18 to 66) meeting DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1 and 2).\n\nStudy 1, a 6-week trial in which patients received fixed citalopram doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 60 mg daily, showed that citalopram 40 daily and 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage) was effective as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. The HAMD-17 is a 17-item, clinician-rated scale used to assess severity of depressive symptoms. Scores on the HAMD-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more severe depression. This study showed no clear effect of the 10 mg and 20 mg daily doses, and the 60 mg daily dose was not more effective than the 40 mg daily dose. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nIn study 2, a 4-week, placebo-controlled trial in patients with MDD, the initial dose was 20 mg daily, followed by titration to the maximum tolerated dose or a maximum dose of 80 mg daily (2 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). Patients treated with citalopram showed statistically significantly greater improvement than placebo patients on the HAMD total score, the primary efficacy endpoint. In three additional placebo-controlled trials in patients with MDD, the difference in response to treatment between patients receiving citalopram and patients receiving placebo was not statistically significant.\n\nIn two long-term studies, patients with MDD who had responded to citalopram during an initial 6 or 8 weeks of acute treatment were randomized to continuation of citalopram or placebo. In one study, patients received fixed doses of citalopram 20 mg or 40 mg daily and in the second study, patients received flexible doses of citalopram 20 mg daily to 60 mg daily (1.5 times the maximum recommended daily dosage). In both studies, patients receiving continued citalopram treatment experienced statistically significantly lower relapse rates over the subsequent 6 months compared to those receiving placebo. In the fixed-dose study, the decreased rate of depression relapse was similar in patients receiving 20 mg or 40 mg daily of citalopram. Due to the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias, the maximum recommended dosage of citalopram is 40 mg once daily.\n\nAnalyses of the relationship between treatment outcome and age, gender, and race did not suggest any differential responsiveness on the basis of these patient characteristics.\n\n## 17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION\nAdvise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).\n\nSuicidal Thoughts and Behaviors\n\nAdvise patients and caregivers to look for the emergence of suicidality, especially early during treatment and when the dosage is adjusted up or down, and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] .\n\nQT Prolongation and Torsade de Pointes\n\nAdvise patients to consult their health care provider immediately if they feel faint, lose consciousness, or have heart palpitations. Instruct patients to inform their health care provider that they are taking citalopram before taking any new medications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nSerotonin Syndrome\n\nCaution patients about the risk of serotonin syndrome, particularly with the concomitant use of citalopram with other serotonergic drugs including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, St. John\u2019s Wort, and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (in particular, MAOIs, both those intended to treat psychiatric disorders and also others, such as linezolid). Instruct patients to contact their health care provider or report to the emergency room if they experience signs or symptoms of serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) , Drug Interactions (7) ] .\n\nIncreased Risk of Bleeding\n\nInform patients about the concomitant use of citalopram with aspirin, NSAIDs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, or other anticoagulants because the combined use has been associated with an increased risk of bleeding. Advise patients to inform their health care providers if they are taking or planning to take any prescription or over-the counter medications that increase the risk of bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ].\n\nActivation of Mania or Hypomania\n\nAdvise patients and their caregivers to observe for signs of activation of mania/hypomania and instruct them to report such symptoms to the healthcare provider [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ].\n\nDiscontinuation Syndrome\n\nAdvise patients not to abruptly discontinue citalopram and to discuss any tapering regimen with their healthcare provider. Inform patients that adverse reactions can occur when citalopram is discontinued [See Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ].\n\nSexual Dysfunction\n\nAdvise patients that use of citalopram may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction in both male and female patients. Inform patients that they should discuss any changes in sexual function and potential management strategies with their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] .\n\nPregnancy\n\nLactation\n\nAdvise breastfeeding women to monitor infants for excess sedation, restlessness, agitation, poor feeding and poor weight gain and to seek medical care if they notice these signs [see Use in Specific Populations (8.2) ] .\n\nDispense with Medication Guide available at: www.aurobindousa.com/medication-guides\n\nRepackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc.\n\n625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701\n\n(724) 465-8762\n\n- Advise patients to notify their healthcare provider if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with citalopram [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise patients that citalopram use late in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, tube feeding, and/or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n- Advise women that there is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to citalopram during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] .\n\n## PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL\nDRUG: Citalopram\n\nGENERIC: Citalopram Hydrobromide\n\nDOSAGE: TABLET, FILM COATED\n\nADMINSTRATION: ORAL\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-0\n\nNDC: 70518-4334-1\n\nCOLOR: white\n\nSHAPE: CAPSULE\n\nSCORE: Two even pieces\n\nSIZE: 12 mm\n\nIMPRINT: A;0;7\n\nPACKAGING: 1 in 1 POUCH\n\nOUTER PACKAGING: 100 in 1 BOX\n\nACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\nINACTIVE INGREDIENT(S):\n\n- CITALOPRAM HYDROBROMIDE 40mg in 1\n\n- COPOVIDONE K25-31\n- STARCH, CORN\n- CROSCARMELLOSE SODIUM\n- LACTOSE MONOHYDRATE\n- MAGNESIUM STEARATE\n- HYPROMELLOSE 2910 (6 MPA.S)\n- MICROCRYSTALLINE CELLULOSE\n- POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 400\n- TITANIUM DIOXIDE"
