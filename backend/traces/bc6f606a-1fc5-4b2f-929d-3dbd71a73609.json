            "trace_explanation_user_friendly": "\"Let me explain how I came up with this answer about lemon ice water! First, I checked if this was a question I could safely answer - like a pharmacist would do before giving advice. Since it was about a common drink, I looked through trusted medical sources (kind of like checking a really good health library). But I noticed there wasn't enough solid medical information to make specific claims about lemon ice water's benefits. That's why I responded carefully, asking for more details about why you're interested in it, and suggesting you talk with your healthcare provider - just like a helpful pharmacy assistant would do if they needed more information to give you the best advice. I made sure to explain everything in simple, friendly terms and included important safety notes, since your health and safety always come first!\"",

First, I checked if this was a question I could safely answer - like a pharmacist would do before giving advice. Since it was about a common drink, I looked through trusted medical sources (kind of like checking a really good health library). But I noticed there wasn't enough solid medical information to make specific claims about lemon ice water's benefits. That's why I responded carefully, asking for more details about why you're interested in it, and suggesting you talk with your healthcare provider - just like a helpful pharmacy assistant would do if they needed more information to give you the best advice.
