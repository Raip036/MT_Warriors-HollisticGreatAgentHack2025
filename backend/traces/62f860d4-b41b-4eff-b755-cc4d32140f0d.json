            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation. Each drug was given for three weeks. Methylphenidate resulted in significantly improved behavior in the children as rated by mothers and teachers, and on tests of impulsivity and motor control. There were no significant improvements in either of the caffeine conditions, although some children showed some slight improvements with caffeine.

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse. Pay attention to your body and work with your doctor to find out what is best for you.\n\nThe Benefits of ADHD\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Guanfacine for ADHD?\n\nDoes Nutrition Play a Role in ADHD?\n\nWhat Is Caffeine, and Is It Good or Bad for Health?\n\nA Day In the Life with ADHD: The Ups and Downs\n\nThe Hidden Struggles of a Woman with ADHD\n\nThe Four Greatest Myths About ADHD\n\nADHD and Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nIs There a Connection Between ADHD and Tics?\n\nWhat to Know About the Relationship Between ADHD and Skin Picking Disorder"

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

          "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

          "content": "The American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should never consume energy drinks. monkeybusinessimages/istock via Getty Images\n\n*Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

The surprising thing is that this also happens when my estrogen levels go super high.\n\n*Upvotes: 8*"

          "content": "**Question:**\nI recently got my diagnosis and got meds for it (and they were great, but that's not why I'm posting).Before meds I used to have a pretty bad \"addiction\" to energy drinks. I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation.

          "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse. Pay attention to your body and work with your doctor to find out what is best for you.\n\nThe Benefits of ADHD\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Guanfacine for ADHD?\n\nDoes Nutrition Play a Role in ADHD?\n\nWhat Is Caffeine, and Is It Good or Bad for Health?\n\nA Day In the Life with ADHD: The Ups and Downs\n\nThe Hidden Struggles of a Woman with ADHD\n\nThe Four Greatest Myths About ADHD\n\nADHD and Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nIs There a Connection Between ADHD and Tics?\n\nWhat to Know About the Relationship Between ADHD and Skin Picking Disorder"

What you need to know.\nURL: https://www.getinflow.io/post/energy-drinks-and-adhd?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

I just got diagnosed with ADHD and I'm new to medication. I am on Adderall XR 15 mg. I am a big fan of energy drinks like Monster, mostly because I like the taste of their punch drinks.I know it's bad to mix caffeine and stimulants but is it like death level bad or just inadvisable? And, is it fine to drink one once the meds wear off (for me that's about 7-8 hours after taking) or is there still enough in your bloodstream to have negative effects? I love the drinks and I miss drinking them, but I dont want to accidentally give myself a heart attack. It is so hard to find specific information on google and I was hoping people here might have some good sources of info I can read or personal experience.\n\n**Answer:**\nMy doctor advised me to strictly avoid consuming products like energy drinks or pre-workouts that are cranked up in caffeine.\n\n*Upvotes: 50*\n\n[4] r/adhdwomen on Reddit: So...uhhh....turns out taking your meds with energy drinks/soft drinks will make them less effective....\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/uk0n83/souhhhturns_out_taking_your_meds_with_energy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n**Question:**\nI started a new job a few months ago that has me up at 530-6am. I am NOT a morning person. So I started taking my dexedrine with a diet v every morning.I noticed my meds weren't working as well as they were before, I figured I was just getting too used to them, needed to go up a dose, and the big change in job were making my symptoms worse.Yeah, no.....energy drinks and soda are high in citric acid. Apparently citric acid/acidic foods, along with vitamin c (in juice or sports drinks) reduces the effectiveness of your body to absorb adhd meds. Supposedly this is a big reason why some days it seems like the meds aren't working.So no diet v or pepsi max for one hour before or after meds. This is going to be so hard for me, especially as I have a pepsi max at lunch time, not long after I take my meds. I COULD try to make the one hour wait thing, a thing....but I work in a laboratory and have to go up a flight of stairs to the lunch room/lockers.....I COULD also just drink water, but like....fuck water.Thank you for coming to my TED talk.\n\n**Answer:**\n\"But like.. fuck water\" Mood \ud83d\ude0f\n\n*Upvotes: 45*\n\n[5] Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety and depression drugs consume energy drinks and coffee?\nURL: https://theconversation.com/should-teens-taking-adhd-anxiety-and-depression-drugs-consume-energy-drinks-and-coffee-166864?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should never consume energy drinks. monkeybusinessimages/istock via Getty Images\n\n*Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us\n\n[7] Caffeine and ADHD: How Do Caffeinated Drinks Affect ADHD\nURL: https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/adhd-caffeine?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n- ADHD\n\n- Reference\n\n- Overview What Is ADHD?ADHD in WomenADHD in People of Color\n\n- What Is ADHD?\n\n- ADHD in Women\n\n- ADHD in People of Color\n\n- Symptoms\n\n- Causes & Risks\n\n- Tests & Diagnosis\n\n- Treatment Understanding Your OptionsDrug TherapiesWhich Drug Is Right for You?Drug Side Effects & RisksNon-Drug Therapies\n\n- Understanding Your Options\n\n- Drug Therapies\n\n- Which Drug Is Right for You?\n\n- Drug Side Effects & Risks\n\n- Non-Drug Therapies\n\n- Living With Daily LifeSchool & WorkFamily & RelationshipsMental & Emotional HealthDiet & Exercise\n\n- Daily Life\n\n- School & Work\n\n- Family & Relationships\n\n- Mental & Emotional Health\n\n- Diet & Exercise\n\n- Complications\n\n- View Full Guide\n\nThe most common treatment for ADHD is stimulant therapy. These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health\n\n[8] r/ADHD on Reddit: Have any of you ever had an energy drink while on a stimulant?

This was on Wednesday and I feel like I'm still feeling the effects. Wednesday-Friday's experience I would expect to be as it was, but today, my heart still feels like its aching. I did a pulse count to check for tachycardia but it was consistently about 100.Anyone else engaged in this foolishness? What happened?

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation. Each drug was given for three weeks. Methylphenidate resulted in significantly improved behavior in the children as rated by mothers and teachers, and on tests of impulsivity and motor control. There were no significant improvements in either of the caffeine conditions, although some children showed some slight improvements with caffeine. The negative side effects with both caffeine and methylphenidate were minimal.\" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002713809623001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002713809623001)\u201cCaffeine with a half-life of about four hours is only going to help them pay attention in first, maybe second period, and that\u2019s about it. Whereas with the ADHD meds, they are formulated so that they are slow release and longer lasting, so that you can get management of symptoms over the whole day.\u201d [https://www.psycom.net/adhd/adhd-and-caffeine](https://www.psycom.net/adhd/adhd-and-caffeine)\n\n**Answer:**\nI used to drink two cups of coffee every morning. It\u2019s nothing like ADHD medication for me. It wakes my body up, but it doesn\u2019t do anything for my mind. I drank cold brew too.\n\n*Upvotes: 18*\n\n[10] How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD\nURL: https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/caffeine?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse. Pay attention to your body and work with your doctor to find out what is best for you.\n\nThe Benefits of ADHD\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Guanfacine for ADHD?\n\nDoes Nutrition Play a Role in ADHD?\n\nWhat Is Caffeine, and Is It Good or Bad for Health?\n\nA Day In the Life with ADHD: The Ups and Downs\n\nThe Hidden Struggles of a Woman with ADHD\n\nThe Four Greatest Myths About ADHD\n\nADHD and Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nIs There a Connection Between ADHD and Tics?\n\nWhat to Know About the Relationship Between ADHD and Skin Picking Disorder\n\nTASKS:\n1.

            "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them.

Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation. Each drug was given for three weeks. Methylphenidate resulted in significantly improved behavior in the children as rated by mothers and teachers, and on tests of impulsivity and motor control. There were no significant improvements in either of the caffeine conditions, although some children showed some slight improvements with caffeine.

            "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse. Pay attention to your body and work with your doctor to find out what is best for you.\n\nThe Benefits of ADHD\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Guanfacine for ADHD?\n\nDoes Nutrition Play a Role in ADHD?\n\nWhat Is Caffeine, and Is It Good or Bad for Health?\n\nA Day In the Life with ADHD: The Ups and Downs\n\nThe Hidden Struggles of a Woman with ADHD\n\nThe Four Greatest Myths About ADHD\n\nADHD and Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nIs There a Connection Between ADHD and Tics?\n\nWhat to Know About the Relationship Between ADHD and Skin Picking Disorder"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

                "content": "The American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should never consume energy drinks. monkeybusinessimages/istock via Getty Images\n\n*Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation. Each drug was given for three weeks. Methylphenidate resulted in significantly improved behavior in the children as rated by mothers and teachers, and on tests of impulsivity and motor control. There were no significant improvements in either of the caffeine conditions, although some children showed some slight improvements with caffeine. The negative side effects with both caffeine and methylphenidate were minimal.\" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002713809623001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002713809623001)\u201cCaffeine with a half-life of about four hours is only going to help them pay attention in first, maybe second period, and that\u2019s about it.

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

                  "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

              "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

              "content": "The American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should never consume energy drinks. monkeybusinessimages/istock via Getty Images\n\n*Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

              "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

              "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

Apparently citric acid/acidic foods, along with vitamin c (in juice or sports drinks) reduces the effectiveness of your body to absorb adhd meds. Supposedly this is a big reason why some days it seems like the meds aren't working.So no diet v or pepsi max for one hour before or after meds. This is going to be so hard for me, especially as I have a pepsi max at lunch time, not long after I take my meds.

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

              "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

              "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation.

              "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

                "content": "The American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should never consume energy drinks. monkeybusinessimages/istock via Getty Images\n\n*Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation.

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation.

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

              "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them.

              "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

              "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

              "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

              "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

              "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

Apparently citric acid/acidic foods, along with vitamin c (in juice or sports drinks) reduces the effectiveness of your body to absorb adhd meds.

This is going to be so hard for me, especially as I have a pepsi max at lunch time, not long after I take my meds.

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can.

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

People couldn't glance at me without me blowing up and wanting to kill them. Learned rather quickly not to drink anything caffeinated while on ritalin. The surprising thing is that this also happens when my estrogen levels go super high.\n\n*Upvotes: 8*"

                "content": "**Question:**\nI recently got my diagnosis and got meds for it (and they were great, but that's not why I'm posting).Before meds I used to have a pretty bad \"addiction\" to energy drinks. I'm constantly tired and I worked a job that made me need to wake up at 6 am (and I used to go to sleep at that time).Used to drink at least one (often, two) energy drinks before leaving home and 3-4 more at work to be able to focus enough (office job).I used to drink even more in the past when I worked in retail, but I cut them in half or more.By the way, heart is fine, checked yesterday (doctor asked).Thing is that energy drinks didn't make me jittery and I didn't have much energy even after them. It was like I was returning to the baseline level for a short time and it was easier to focus. Of course, I know how everyone around me was affected in different way by energy drink so I tried to find some studies about them.\"For children with ADHD, caffeine was more effective than no treatment in decreasing impulsivity, aggression, and parents' and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and more effective than placebo in decreasing hyperactivity and teachers' perceptions of children's symptom severity, and in improving executive functioning/planning.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/108705470000400103)\" This study offers evidence to support a curvilinear pattern of dose-response for caffeine, in attenuating the behavioural manifestations of this syndrome.\" [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/070674378102600602)\"Twenty-one hyperactive children received in turn 500 mg. caffeine, 300 mg. caffeine, and 20 mg. methylphenidate per day in a double-blind crossover design investigation. Each drug was given for three weeks. Methylphenidate resulted in significantly improved behavior in the children as rated by mothers and teachers, and on tests of impulsivity and motor control. There were no significant improvements in either of the caffeine conditions, although some children showed some slight improvements with caffeine. The negative side effects with both caffeine and methylphenidate were minimal.\" [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002713809623001](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002713809623001)\u201cCaffeine with a half-life of about four hours is only going to help them pay attention in first, maybe second period, and that\u2019s about it. Whereas with the ADHD meds, they are formulated so that they are slow release and longer lasting, so that you can get management of symptoms over the whole day.\u201d [https://www.psycom.net/adhd/adhd-and-caffeine](https://www.psycom.net/adhd/adhd-and-caffeine)\n\n**Answer:**\nI used to drink two cups of coffee every morning. It\u2019s nothing like ADHD medication for me. It wakes my body up, but it doesn\u2019t do anything for my mind. I drank cold brew too.\n\n*Upvotes: 18*"

                "url": "https://www.healthline.com/health/adhd/caffeine?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral",
                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse. Pay attention to your body and work with your doctor to find out what is best for you.\n\nThe Benefits of ADHD\n\nWhat Do I Need to Know About Guanfacine for ADHD?\n\nDoes Nutrition Play a Role in ADHD?\n\nWhat Is Caffeine, and Is It Good or Bad for Health?\n\nA Day In the Life with ADHD: The Ups and Downs\n\nThe Hidden Struggles of a Woman with ADHD\n\nThe Four Greatest Myths About ADHD\n\nADHD and Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\nIs There a Connection Between ADHD and Tics?\n\nWhat to Know About the Relationship Between ADHD and Skin Picking Disorder"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence provided, here is what we know about mixing energy drinks with ADHD medication:\n\nKEY SAFETY CONCERNS:\n- It is generally NOT recommended to mix energy drinks with ADHD medications because both contain stimulants that can have additive effects\n- The combination can lead to increased side effects like:\n  - Anxiety and irritability\n  - Rapid heart rate\n  - Insomnia/sleep problems\n  - Stomach upset\n  - Muscle tremors\n  - Higher blood pressure\n\nMECHANISMS:\n- Both caffeine and ADHD medications are stimulants that affect neurotransmitters like dopamine\n- When combined, they have a \"synergistic effect\" - meaning they amplify each other's impacts on the body\n- The vitamin C/citric acid in energy drinks can also reduce the effectiveness of some ADHD medications\n\nTIMING CONSIDERATIONS:\n- If you do consume caffeine, it's recommended to:\n  - Only have it in the morning, not late in the day\n  - Wait at least 1 hour before/after taking ADHD medication\n  - Stay well under 400mg of caffeine per day (about 2-3 cups of coffee worth)\n\nThe evidence strongly suggests avoiding energy drinks specifically, as they:\n- Contain very high caffeine levels\n- Often have additional stimulants\n- Include high sugar content\n- Contain citric acid that can interfere with medication absorption\n\nIMPORTANT: While this information comes from medical sources, you should discuss your specific situation with your doctor, as individual reactions can vary. They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

                "content": "The American Academy of Pediatrics says teens should never consume energy drinks. monkeybusinessimages/istock via Getty Images\n\n*Curious Kids is a series for children of all ages. If you have a question you\u2019d like an expert to answer, send it to CuriousKidsUS@theconversation.com.*\n\n> Should teens taking ADHD, anxiety or depression drugs consume energy drinks or coffee? \u2013 Angela S.\n\nAbout [6.1 million children in the U.S.](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/data.html), more than 9% of all kids and teens, have been [diagnosed at some point in their lives with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/adhd/what-is-adhd). Known as ADHD, it causes inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity.\n\nMany kids and teens diagnosed with ADHD take [prescription stimulants](https://drugfree.org/drugs/prescription-stimulants/), such as Adderall and Ritalin. These drugs increase brain activity to counteract a lack of focus and poor concentration.\n\nIn addition, 6 in 10 children diagnosed with ADHD have [at least one other mental, emotional or behavioral disorder](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350895), such as anxiety or depression. As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.

First, I recognized this was a question about medication safety, so I knew I needed to be extra thorough. I consulted multiple trusted medical sources - kind of like checking several medical reference books and official health websites - to understand how energy drinks and ADHD medications interact. Since this information could affect someone's health, I made sure to explain everything in simple, friendly language (like how a good pharmacy assistant would talk to you at the counter), and I double-checked all the facts to make sure the advice was safe and accurate. I also made sure to include the important reminder that while I can provide helpful information, your doctor knows your specific situation best.",

They can provide personalized guidance on caffeine consumption that takes into account your medication, dosage, and overall health status.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions about the evidence provided!",

                "content": "# Energy drinks for ADHD: Friend or foe? What you need to know.\n\nIf you can't imagine a workday without the jolt of caffeine, this one's for you.\n\nIf you have ADHD, you might have a hard time resisting caffeine. Maybe your caffeine tolerance led you to energy drinks\u2014an increasingly popular caffeine source. But what's really inside these drinks?\n\nYou may recognize ingredients like ginseng and L-theanine, associating them with familiar beverages like tea, but what about the other suspicious additions in your can of Red Bull or Monster? And how do these ingredients affect people with ADHD and their symptoms?\n\nGet ready to sip on our (caffeine-free) insights on ADHD and energy drinks. We promise only to pour the facts.\n\n#### Too long; didn't read\n\n- Caffeine can affect people with ADHD differently than neurotypical people.\n\n- Ginseng, L-theanine, taurine, citric acid, sugar, and food dyes are common ingredients in energy drinks, each with varying effects on ADHD symptoms.\n\n- Consuming caffeinated beverages may be a form of addiction or self-medication for people with ADHD.\n\n- Tips for cutting back on energy drinks include tracking caffeine intake, trying decaf or low-caffeine alternatives, cutting back gradually, and improving your sleep habits.\n\n## How does caffeine affect ADHD symptoms?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that can make you feel more awake, alert, and productive under the right conditions.\n\nMany assumptions about the effects of caffeine on ADHDers are often inaccurate or exaggerated, as they are more correlated with factors outside of the neurotype. Some people with ADHD experience a paradoxical effect of caffeine and feel sleepier after consuming it.\n\nBut even though caffeine has a calming effect on some of us, there's no concrete evidence to suggest that ADHD brains are more likely to experience paradoxical caffeine reactions.\n\n\ud83e\udde0 ADHD research! A study of US Army soldiers found that caffeine positively affected cognition and impulsive behavior and deemed caffeine a \"promising treatment tool.\"1\n\n## Energy drink ingredients and ADHD\n\n### Caffeine\n\nMost healthy adults can drink up to 400 mg of caffeine a day, but many coffee and tea drinkers never reach this limit. Others may not realize how quickly it adds up.\n\nFor example, 8 ounces of filter coffee contain an average of 145 mg caffeine, and one can of Monster contains 160 mg.\n\n\u26a0\ufe0f Heads up! Caffeine can have adverse side effects when consumed excessively, including headaches, insomnia, irritability, fast heartbeat, and muscle tremors.\n\nCaffeine is the primary stimulant ingredient in energy drinks, but they contain several other ingredients to be aware of.\n\n### L-theanine\n\nFound in tea, supplements, and high concentrations in energy drinks, L-theanine has proven health benefits, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.2\n\nFor people with ADHD, L-theanine may improve attention and impulsive behaviors.3\n\n### Taurine\n\nTaurine is an amino acid naturally produced in your body, protecting neurotransmitters (chemical messengers) that deliver feel-good dopamine. In supplement form, it can treat conditions like congestive heart disease, anxiety, seizures, hypertension, and ADHD.\n\nTaurine can also improve hyperactive behavior and brain function in rats, suggesting that high doses of taurine could help with ADHD symptoms. However, lower dosages seem to have the opposite effect.4\n\n### Ginseng\n\nKorean red ginseng, also known as \"Panax\" ginseng, has been shown to have positive effects on neurotransmitters and the central nervous system, leading to enhanced cognitive function.5\n\nFor people with ADHD, Korean red ginseng may help with inattentiveness, short-term memory problems, and executive dysfunction.6\n\n### Artificial food coloring\n\nSome may experience worsened ADHD symptoms from consuming artificial food dyes.\n\nAnd unfortunately, energy drinks only vaguely refer to added colors on their labels, but the odds are they're there.\n\n### Sugar and artificial sweeteners\n\nSugar can affect ADHD symptoms and increase hyperactivity. Though artificial sweeteners continue to be debated, both forms of sweetener arguably contribute to habit-forming behaviors and the overall appeal of energy drinks.\n\n### Citric acid and vitamin C\n\nCitric acid (aka vitamin C) is found in most energy drinks. If you take your ADHD meds with energy drinks, listen up!\n\nVitamin C can prevent proper medication absorption if consumed around the same time. It's best to avoid foods high in vitamin C and citric acid while taking certain ADHD medications, including Adderall, Dexedrine, and Vyvanse.\n\n## Can caffeine treat ADHD?\n\nAn outdated (but widely cited) study found that caffeine slightly improved brain function.7 Those who cite this study often fail to mention that these results were insignificant, as they weren't much better than the placebo group.\n\nResearchers concluded that prescription stimulant medications were far superior to caffeine when treating ADHD symptoms.7\n\n### Self-medicating with caffeine\n\nUnsurprisingly, many ADHDers turn to caffeine as a form of self-medication, whether they're aware of it or not. This is especially true for those who don't have access to a formal diagnosis or prescription medication.\n\nBut does it help?\n\nSurprisingly, yes... to an extent.\n\nOne study found that regular coffee and tea consumers with ADHD - but not those who consumed energy drinks or cola - have slightly better psychological well-being than non-consumers with ADHD.8 But there's a catch!\n\nThe data also suggests a connection between ADHD symptoms and caffeine use disorder (yes, it's real), which is associated with lower psychological well-being.8 This seems to be an instance where balance is key.\n\n## Addiction, caffeine, and ADHD\n\nMany ADHDers are prone to addictive behaviors in pursuit of the rush of dopamine and instant gratification we get from engaging with them. The immediate perceived 'results' of energy drinks can be hard to resist.\n\nWhen mixed with alcohol, another common addiction across ADHDers and neurotypicals alike, caffeine can...\n\n- mask the effects of the depressant (alcohol)\n\n- make drinkers feel more alert\n\n- contribute to a 4x increase in the likelihood of binge drinking\n\nLike the possible interactions with prescription medications, energy drinks can also negatively influence other ADHD-related symptoms and behaviors.\n\n## How to cut back on caffeine and energy drinks\n\nLooking to cut back on energy drinks? Here are a few strategies you can try.\n\n- Use the low-dopamine morning routine to energize your mornings without relying on a cup of tea, coffee, or energy drinks.\n\n- Consider tracking your caffeine intake to be mindful of healthy limits. (A simple journal will do, but there are also plenty of apps for habit tracking!)\n\n- Try decaf or low-caffeine versions of your favorite beverages.\n\n- Cut back gradually to reduce withdrawal symptoms as your body adjusts.\n\n- Take steps to improve your sleep quality so you don't feel the \"need\" for caffeine.\n\n- Work with an ADHD coach to develop better habits around sleep and other behaviors.\n\n## Final thoughts: Learn from my experience with caffeine\n\nI spent several years in management at A Big Coffee Company\u2122, which meant unlimited access to iced coffee and an unhealthy relationship with work. Nearly a decade later, my caffeine intake was A Big Problem\u2122.\n\nMultiple cups of coffee was a daily habit in high school to keep up with AP courses and a part-time job. A few years later, I chugged several energy drinks daily, easily doubling the recommended 400 mg maximum.\n\nTo say I was addicted is an understatement. It was actually easier for me to get sober from an alcohol problem than it was to cut back on caffeine.\n\nI'm 3.5 years free from alcohol, but only recently managed to lower my energy drink consumption.\n\nI had this problem years before my ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Looking back, it seems caffeine was always a means of subconscious self-medication.\n\nEventually, I convinced myself that this habit did more harm than good. It was also expensive and reduced the effectiveness of my Adderall. Researching the ingredients in energy drinks helped me identify why I kept drinking this delicious carbonated battery acid.\n\nThat's just my experience, of course. While I believe many ADHDers will relate, I encourage you to work with a medical professional when changing your diet, medication, or other health factors.\n\nIf I can do it, you can. (Trust me on this one.)\n\n\u200d\n\n-\n\n###### Sources\n\n1 Journal of Clinical Medicine | Exploring the Role of Caffeine Use in Adult-ADHD Symptom Severity of US Army Soldiers (2020)2 Frontiers in Nutrition | L-Theanine: A Unique Functional Amino Acid in Tea (Camellia sinensis L.)

However, as fantastic as they are \u2013 are energy drinks safe for people with ADHD? The relationship between energy drinks and ADHD is a complicated one, and studies are still trying to understand it completely, but one thing seems to be for certain: energy drinks and ADHD are not the best pairing, and in fact, energy drinks are not very good for anyone at all.\n\nBut, why? And what other options are there for trying to improve your focus if you have ADHD, or even if you don\u2019t? We will go through all the details in this blog, covering how energy drinks impact people with ADHD, the role of caffeine in ADHD management, and more.\n\nAt the Brain Workshop, we are dedicated to helping you traverse the world of ADHD, autism, and more. From helping you see the early signs of ADHD in children and debunking ADHD myths, to helping you manage ADHD in the workplace and support in schools.\n\n## How do Energy Drinks Affect People with ADHD?\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant and the reason why energy drinks give you energy. For neurotypical people, caffeine can help with alertness and increase focus, but too much caffeine can also have negative effects, like insomnia, upset stomach, migraines, and more.\n\nPeople with ADHD can experience very different effects from caffeine, however. Some individuals can feel sleepier after having caffeine and general paradoxical effects, but this won\u2019t be the case for everyone.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to mention that the sugar in energy drinks also leads to a spike in energy levels in people. Whether you have ADHD or not, this is key to remember, and especially important if you are diabetic or have insulin resistance, as there can be additional negative effects of consuming these drinks.\n\nSo, energy drinks can temporarily improve focus due to caffeine, but for individuals with ADHD, they may also increase anxiety, restlessness, and heart rate, making moderation essential. For some people, it might even be recommended to avoid caffeine altogether, but this is something that you should speak to your doctor about, or try cutting down on caffeine intake to see if you notice any improvements.\n\n## The Role of Caffeine in ADHD Management\n\nThere has been research to suggest that caffeine can help with improving reaction times, logical reasoning, vigilance, and better focus for many people. Since caffeine is a stimulant, and stimulants are often used to treat ADHD, it can help some people with ADHD manage their symptoms.\n\nStimulants work by increasing and balancing neurotransmitters to help with symptoms by increasing activity in parts of the brain that help with focus, but there are also non-stimulant options to help with this disorder.\n\n## Risks of Energy Drinks for ADHD Symptoms\n\nEveryone can experience the negative side effects of too much caffeine from energy drinks, but some individuals with ADHD might feel them more strongly. ADHD-related symptoms can quickly get worse when caffeine is ingested, making it a difficult substance to moderate, especially if you feel reliant on it.\n\n5 Risks of energy drinks for people with ADHD:\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Anxiety\n\n- Upset stomach\n\n- Muscle tremors\n\nSugar can also make ADHD symptoms much worse and can cause dysregulation, as sugar will also stimulate dopamine in the brain. Sugar will also stimulate opioid receptors within the brain, which will make you crave more sugar. As many of us will already know, sugar can cause significant health-related issues, including increased risk of diabetes as well as bad dental health such as cavities.\n\nTypes of sugars to watch out for:\n\n- Agave\n\n- Dextrin\n\n- Corn syrup\n\n- Molasses\n\n- Sucrose\n\n- Dehydrated cane juice\n\n- Rice syrup\n\n- Dextrose\n\nIf you have ADHD, you can still enjoy the occasional energy drink, but we recommend being mindful of your intake. If possible, we would suggest looking for options that contain less sugar and less caffeine, as these two ingredients will likely have the biggest negative effect on you and your ADHD symptoms.\n\nSome safe drinks for ADHD management include decaffeinated drinks. If you love hot drinks, there are caffeine-free teas available or decaf coffee, but there are all kinds of drinks to try if you want to avoid caffeine and help with your ADHD symptoms.\n\n## Are Energy Drinks a Safe Alternative to ADHD Medication?\n\nEnergy drinks are absolutely not a safe alternative to ADHD medication, and it is not recommended to attempt to use energy drinks to self-treat or medicate ADHD. Not only are energy drinks typically full of sugars and a combination of other ingredients that aren\u2019t very good for you, but caffeine impacts everyone in different ways.\n\nWhile caffeine intake can have a calming effect on some people with ADHD, this will not be the case for everyone, either. It\u2019s also important to remember that too much caffeine (over 400 milligrams) can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects, such as irritability, migraines, insomnia, upset stomach, and more.\n\nStudies have also looked into the effectiveness of caffeine as an ADHD medication, and found that the accepted treatment options such as Methylphenidate and Lisdexamfetamine are far more effective. So, while you can enjoy caffeine in moderation, we implore you to exercise caution in your quantities, and don\u2019t let it impact your life by worsening sleep schedules and irritability.\n\n## Safer Ways to Boost Energy and Focus with ADHD\n\nMany people with ADHD struggle with focus and energy, and this can be debilitating. However, there are some things that you can try and do to help improve your energy levels and make you focus more, but they don\u2019t all come easy.\n\nDifficulty with focusing can often make people with ADHD feel lazy, even when this isn\u2019t the case. A short attention span can be frustrating to deal with, and improving it is not something that can be done overnight. Getting support where needed, and having an ADHD-friendly home environment are all incredibly useful, and this can come in many different forms.\n\n### Try More Structure\n\nOne thing that people with ADHD often struggle with is structure, and it\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed with day-to-day life and tasks. By adding more structure to your life and daily routine, you should be able to better organise everything and follow through with tasks to help with executive dysfunction.\n\nPut together a \u2018game plan\u2019 that works for you \u2013 this could be using a calendar or timetable, or creating something else that works for you. You might be surprised by how this can help with energy levels, as you spend less time (and energy) worrying about it.\n\n### Exercise Every Day\n\nDaily exercise is important for everyone, but it could be even more crucial for people with ADHD. Cardiovascular exercise in particular is fantastic, as it releases endorphins and increases the release of dopamine \u2013 a motivational transmitter.\n\n### Take a Moment and Have Fun\n\nIt\u2019s important to step back from work and everything that might be stressing you out and have some fun. Without fun, our brains will just get increasingly tired and stay in survival mode, and this is exhausting. Make sure that you take a break from work when you need it and so something you love, whatever that might be.\n\n## How The Brain Workshop Can Support ADHD Management\n\nLooking for healthier ways to manage energy and focus with ADHD?

As a result, many of them take other kinds of prescription drugs too.\n\nMeanwhile, Monster, Red Bull and other [energy drinks are commonly marketed to teens](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) as a way to boost stamina, physical performance and alertness. This is troubling because of the [high levels of caffeine](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133) those drinks contain.\n\nIngesting large amounts of caffeine [overstimulates the nervous system](https://www.healthline.com/health/caffeine-effects-on-body#Central-nervous-system), which interferes with sleep and can increase stress as well as anxiety.\n\nAccording to recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics, teenagers can consume [up to 100 milligrams of caffeine a day](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), the [equivalent of two 12-ounce cans of soda](https://www.aacap.org/AACAP/Families_and_Youth/Facts_for_Families/FFF-Guide/Caffeine_and_Children-131.aspx), without any trouble.\n\nHowever, [just one energy drink](https://cspinet.org/eating-healthy/ingredients-of-concern/caffeine-chart), and some specialty coffee beverages, can have more than triple this amount of caffeine. In addition, the large amount of sugar in many of these drinks can [disrupt blood sugar](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/mood-blood-sugar-kujawski.html) levels, causing changes in brain chemistry and consequently contributing to mental health problems.\n\nThe [academy also states teens should never consume energy drinks](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/127/6/1182), regardless of prescription drug intake. And yet about [one-third of Americans from 12 to 17 years old](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/energy-drinks) drink these beverages on a regular basis.\n\nI believe that consuming energy drinks is even more dangerous for teens taking prescription drugs for ADHD, anxiety or depression because of the additional stimulants they are getting. They should also curb their [coffee consumption](https://theconversation.com/is-it-ok-for-teens-to-drink-coffee-129133).\n\nThe situation is even more complicated, though, because there are signs that [not all of the young people taking those drugs need them](https://www.tctmd.com/news/adhd-drug-overprescribing-raises-concerns-over-future-cv-events).\n\nThere is evidence that quite often, several ADHD symptoms could be caused by other conditions, such as [stress, certain medications, insomnia and poor nutrition](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-fog). Among the drugs that may trigger these symptoms are those prescribed to treat [anxiety and depression](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/323666).\n\nAs a [nutritional neuroscientist](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=sOMbzQ0AAAAJ) who studies the connections between what people eat and their lifestyle, stress and mental health, I believe that many teens diagnosed with ADHD, anxiety and depression may benefit from changing what they eat before they begin to take any prescription drugs.\n\nOne reason for this is that the [brain has a growth spurt](https://raisingchildren.net.au/pre-teens/development/understanding-your-pre-teen/brain-development-teens) during the teen years. This growth requires essential nutrients, such as [omega-3 fatty acids](https://theconversation.com/want-to-eat-fish-thats-truly-good-for-you-here-are-some-guidelines-to-reeling-one-in-72933) \u2013 typically found in high amounts in fish \u2013 that not all teens get enough of through their [usual diet](https://nutritionj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12937-018-0328-z). A poor-quality diet can interfere with this growth and development, contributing to poor concentration and even mental distress.\n\nPerhaps even more troubling, many teens and college students without any symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder [take ADHD drugs for non-medical reasons](https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/2892/binghamton-university-student-research-group-examines-adderall-abuse). They often do this because of a [mistaken belief](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=23617) that the drugs will help them do better at school.\n\nIn summary, whether or not a young person has a prescription for ADHD drugs, taking them makes avoiding energy drinks essential.\n\n*Hello, curious kids!

Have you ever wondered how caffeine may affect ADHD? The impact of ADHD is known to affect a person in many areas of their life, including academic and professional success, interpersonal connections, and daily functioning. Hence, it is imperative for someone with the disorder to know the relationship between caffeine and ADHD.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ADHD, your doctor might have prescribed a stimulant drug like methylphenidate or amphetamine dextroamphetamine. These stimulants, which affect attention and behavior by increasing the brain\u2019s supply of the neurotransmitter dopamine and norepinephrine, are among the most often given ADHD drugs. Another stimulant that many people use for self-medication is caffeine which also affects neurotransmitters.\n\nNow, the question is; does consuming caffeine, whether it comes from coffee, tea, or any other source, make ADHD symptoms worse or help improve your condition? Furthermore, is it safe to use caffeine and ADHD medicine, or could it be harmful?\n\n## What Effect Does Caffeine Have on The Brain and Body?\n\nWhether you have ADHD or not, the fact that caffeine has an impact on your brain and body cannot be ignored. Most individuals choose to have coffee to become energetic and not feel sleepy. If your caffeine consumption is relatively high, people who already have insomnia or trouble getting a good night\u2019s sleep can face further disturbance in their sleeping patterns. Sleep deprivation can lead to increased forgetfulness, irritability, difficulty controlling your emotions, or even difficulty sitting still and focusing.\n\nWhen someone has ADHD, caffeine has a complex influence on their physiology. One must have a good grip over their coffee intake because not doing so can cause problems like anxiety, panic attacks, and even seizures.\n\n### How Does Caffeine Go With ADHD?\n\nCaffeine should only be consumed in the morning for those with ADHD, and no late-night coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate consumption is advised. ADHD drugs that contain amphetamine also shrink blood arteries. Some of the effects of caffeine may be comparable to those of popular ADHD medicines. Although the precise cause is uncertain, decreased blood flow may aid in treating ADHD. It calms overactive brain regions, enabling them to work more effectively and cooperatively with the rest of the brain. Caffeine helps increase your adrenaline levels and reduce depression.\n\nCoffee is a central nervous system stimulant found to help boost overall mental functioning, improve attention and concentration, reduce fatigue, and improve memory. Caffeine mostly does this by functioning as an antagonist of the adenosine receptor. Caffeine binds to these receptors when we drink coffee, tea, or energy drinks, reducing the impact of adenosine and consequently reducing its effects by subtly enhancing dopamine release.\n\nThe majority of research has been conducted on animals or children, and some are fairly old. Thus, the evidence on caffeine and ADHD is not strong enough to be decisive. According to research, caffeine\u2019s effectiveness for treating ADHD rises with increasing doses, but only until a point at which it starts to decline once more. Based on the meta-analysis from 2000, the dose may be around 150 mg per day for children, but the best timing and dosage, particularly for adults, are still unknown. However, generally, it is encouraging, and several experts have advocated for more research into the potential medical benefits of caffeine for ADHD.\n\n### Caffeine and ADHD Medication\n\nSynergy is a term that defines the combination of caffeine and amphetamine drugs like Adderall, amphetamine, and dextroamphetamine. Synergy occurs when two medications have complementary modes of action, increasing the potency of their combined effects. A person on Adderall, for example, would probably experience a bigger effect, including more adverse effects, as caffeine increases the effectiveness of amphetamines.\n\nWe do know that taking caffeine and ADHD drugs together may potentially put someone at risk of having more serious adverse effects, such as cardiac overstimulation. This is because both are stimulants. However, depending on the dosage of each drug, some patients can combine coffee and ADHD medication, tolerating it well.\n\n### Consultation on Caffeine and ADHD\n\nSee a doctor if you or a family member of yours has ADHD. Even though no single test can definitively confirm or rule out ADHD, a thorough evaluation can aid in making the most precise diagnosis possible.\n\nYour medical background, personal habits, and functional abilities are considered throughout the assessment. Medication is one of the most frequently recommended treatments for people with ADHD. You may also benefit from additional treatments, including psychotherapy, family counseling, behavioral therapy, and medication.\n\n##### See Also: Living With ADHD\n\n### Wrap up\n\nGiven that it acts as a CNS stimulant, caffeine is still an option if you have ADHD and may even provide some advantages. Some studies indicate that taking low to moderate doses of caffeine helps improve focus and reduce harmful ADHD symptoms, including impulsive behavior, but not as well as medication.\n\nNonetheless, more study is needed to draw firm conclusions. More research is required, but caffeine\u2019s health benefits may be increased when combined with the relaxing amino acid L-theanine.\n\nYour caffeine tolerance, if you have a pre-existing medical condition like anxiety or cardiovascular problems, how much sleep you receive, and whether you take stimulant medicine will affect how caffeine affects you.\n\n# Book an Appointment\n\n# Give Us A Call\n\n# (512) 872-6868\n\n# Hear What Our Patients Are Saying.\n\n## Recent Posts\n\n- Personalizing IV Vitamin Therapy: Lab Testing, Dosing, and Who Should Avoid It\n\n- Autoimmune Diseases: Early Warning Signs, Diagnosis, and Treatment Options\n\n- Low Libido: Common Causes and Effective Solutions\n\n- Comprehensive Guide to UTI Testing: What You Need to Know\n\n- Optimizing Diagnostic Accuracy with In-House Laboratory Services\n\n# Quick Links\n\n# Contact Info\n\n# Follow Us"

These drugs can improve your focus and attention span and help control impulsive behavior.\n\nThe most widely used stimulant, and the most popular drug in the world, is caffeine. It's in coffee, tea, chocolate, soda, and other foods.\n\nA few studies have looked at how caffeine can affect ADHD symptoms, but the results have been mixed. Even though caffeine is a stimulant, it's not generally recommended as a treatment for ADHD because it hasn't proved to be as effective as prescription medications.\n\n## How It Works\n\nStimulants, including caffeine, raise the amount of specific chemicals that your brain uses to send signals. One of these is dopamine. It's linked to pleasure, attention, and movement.\n\nWhen you have ADHD, doctors often prescribe stimulants to help you feel calmer and more focused. Some researchers believe that because studies show the caffeine in tea can improve alertness and concentration, it might work for ADHD, too.\n\nSome scientists think caffeine has potential as an ADHD treatment because of its effect on dopamine levels, which improved memory and attention in rats. In another study, when hyperactive rats were given caffeine before they went through a maze, they got better at it. This suggests caffeine can improve spatial learning. While these studies are interesting, rats aren't people.\n\n## The Downside\n\nMore than 400 milligrams of caffeine is more likely to cause problems, including:\n\n- Migraine headaches\n\n- Insomnia\n\n- Irritability\n\n- Upset stomach\n\nA study found that caffeine was much less effective than dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine) and methylphenidate (Concerta, Ritalin), two kinds of medication commonly used to treat ADHD.\n\n## For Children\n\nExperts don't recommend giving caffeine to children, especially if they're taking prescription medication for ADHD. Kids may be more vulnerable to the side effects of caffeine. And it's possible that it can affect brain development in growing children.\n\nWhile an older study found that high doses of caffeine (600 milligrams) every day helped control hyperactivity symptoms in children, there were many side effects.\n\nKids with ADHD generally have more sleep problems and have trouble staying alert during the day. Caffeine can disrupt sleep, which could make these issues worse.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that no children should have energy drinks, since the high levels of stimulants -- including caffeine -- can cause serious health problems.\n\n## Is It Right for You?\n\nCaffeine, like ADHD medications, may affect one person differently than another. Talk to your doctor before you start to use caffeine to help your symptoms.\n\nIf you're taking a prescription stimulant, also taking caffeine could cause more or worse side effects.\n\n### Top doctors in ,\n\n### Find more top doctors on\n\n### Related Links\n\n- ADHD News\n\n- ADHD Reference\n\n- ADHD Slideshows\n\n- ADHD Quizzes\n\n- ADHD Blogs\n\n- ADHD Videos\n\n- ADHD Overview\n\n- ADHD Symptoms\n\n- ADHD Causes\n\n- ADHD Diagnosis\n\n- ADHD Treatments\n\n- ADHD Medications\n\n- Find a Psychiatrist\n\n- ADHD Community\n\n- ADHD in Children\n\n- Anxiety/Panic\n\n- Bipolar Disorder\n\n- Brain & Nervous System\n\n- Drug Interaction Checker\n\n- Foods to Help You Focus\n\n- Mental Health"

                "content": "# How Does Caffeine Affect ADHD?\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine ADHD medications combine, their combined effect is more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so someone taking Adderall would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.Caffeine is found in coffee, tea, and chocolate to name a few, and it\u2019s one of the world\u2019s favorite drugs. But what impact does it have on your brain? The right amount of caffeine can help you focus, but too much might make you jittery, anxious, or irritable.Because caffeine is so prevalent, it\u2019s important to know how it affects individuals with ADHD.\n\n## Stimulating the body\n\nCaffeine is considered a stimulant. It stimulates the body\u2019s central nervous system, and boosts the brain\u2019s production of a neurochemical known as dopamine, which controls the ability to focus and maintain concentration.\n\nThis stimulation can cause a person to feel energized and not to feel the effects of fatigue as strongly.\n\nSometimes the effect can be negative, however. For example, people who have trouble sleeping can experience further sleep disturbances or insomnia due to caffeine.\n\n### Reduced sleep\n\nSleep deprivation can cause ADHD-like symptoms. These include:\n\n- irritability - increased forgetfulness - trouble focusing or sitting still - difficulty controlling emotions\n\nSleep deprivation makes these symptoms worse in people with ADHD.\n\nPeople with ADHD should only use caffeine in the morning and should avoid consumption of coffee, tea, soda, or chocolate in the evening or late at night.\n\n### Reduced blood flow to the brain\n\nCaffeine is also a vasoconstrictor. That means it makes blood vessels smaller and reduces blood flow. This reduced blood flow is why caffeine helps headaches.\n\nAmphetamine medications used to treat ADHD also make blood vessels smaller, while increasing blood flow in others.\n\nAlthough the exact reason is unknown and data is limited, reduced blood flow may help treat ADHD by reducing the activity of brain regions that are overactive, allowing them to better function and cooperate with the rest of the brain.\n\n## Using caffeine for concentration\n\nDopamine levels in the brain have to be within a very narrow margin in order for a person to be able to focus on their work. But in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low. Stimulant chemicals such as caffeine or amphetamines tend to increase dopamine levels.\n\nFor most people, adding stimulants will push dopamine levels too high, causing agitation and anxiety. But for people with ADHD, adding stimulants can get the levels just right.\n\nSome studies have found that caffeine can boost concentration for people with ADHD. Since it\u2019s a stimulant drug, it mimics some of the effects of stronger stimulants used to treat ADHD, such as amphetamine medications.\n\nHowever, caffeine alone is less effective than prescription medications. There are no studies that suggest that caffeine can be an effective treatment for ADHD.\n\n## Using caffeine with ADHD medications\n\nWhen caffeine and amphetamine medications like Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) combine, they cause an effect called synergy.\n\nSynergy occurs when two drugs have additive mechanisms of action, making their combined effect more powerful. Caffeine intensifies the effects of amphetamines, so a person taking Adderall, for example, would likely feel a stronger impact, including greater side effects.\n\n## Risks of using caffeine\n\nThe FDA defines the maximum safe amount of caffeine for healthy adults as four or less cups of coffee per day, or 400 mg. Too much caffeine may cause:\n\n- sleeplessness - rapid heartbeat - irritability - anxiety - insomnia - muscle shakes or tremors - upset stomach\n\nSince medication combinations are very hard to control, a person taking both amphetamines and caffeine will also get a double dose of their side effects. Both drugs can cause anxiety, difficultly sleeping, nausea, and stomach pains.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anxiety or difficulty sleeping, you may be ingesting too much caffeine. Make sure to always take both your medication and caffeine with food to control stomach pains. Talk to your doctor if nausea persists.\n\n## Everyone is different\n\nAlthough emerging research is finding that ADHD has a genetic component, it\u2019s also finding that ADHD is not just one thing. Rather, people with mutations at any number of points in their genetics might get classified with ADHD.\n\nFor developing children, some brain regions might develop at different rates than the other regions that regulate them. Because ADHD has different causes, treatments can affect people differently.\n\nSome people find that caffeine helps their ADHD, while others find that it doesn\u2019t offer any benefit at all, or even makes their focus worse.
