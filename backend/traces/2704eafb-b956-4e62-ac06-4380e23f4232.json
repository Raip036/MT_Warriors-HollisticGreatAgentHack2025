Safety Evaluation\n- Safety advisor detected problematic content\n- Risk level elevated to \"medium\"\n- Handoff recommendation changed to \"true\"\n- Safety advisor encountered JSON parsing error but maintained fail-safe response\n- Identified hate speech/discriminatory content requiring intervention\n\n3. Tool Integration\n- No external API calls made (Valyu, drug databases, etc.)\n- Core LLM used for base response generation\n- Safety filters engaged as primary response mechanism\n\n4. Medical Answer Construction\n- Canonical answer focused on:\n  * Declining to engage with inappropriate content\n  * Offering to help with legitimate medical queries\n  * Maintaining professional medical ethics\n- Citations included (mock example source)\n- Warning flags added for potential high-risk situation\n\n5. PharmaMiku Transformation\n- Converted technical response to kawaii/gentle tone\n- Added structured format with bullet points\n- Incorporated key medical safety disclaimers\n- Maintained professional boundaries while being approachable\n- Added visual elements (kaomoji, emojis) appropriately\n\n6. Judge Agent Review\n- Verdict: \"BORDERLINE\"\n- Identified missing safety warnings\n- Added additional urgent care recommendation\n- Ensured response maintained:\n  * Clear boundaries\n  * Professional medical standards\n  * Appropriate safety escalation guidance\n  * Resource referrals\n\nPipeline successfully handled inappropriate content while:\n- Maintaining medical professionalism\n- Offering alternative assistance paths\n- Preserving safety protocols\n- Providing clear escalation guidance\n- Documenting decision chain for audit\n\nThe system demonstrated appropriate content filtering while maintaining its medical assistant role and safety protocols.",
