Input Classification\n- Input Classifier analyzed \"I have a headache\"\n- Classified as:\n  - Intent: \"other\"\n  - Query Type: \"general_question\"\n  - Risk Level: \"low\"\n  - Age Group: \"unknown\"\n- Rationale: Simple symptom statement without emergency indicators\n\n## 2. Safety Assessment\nSafety Advisor evaluated query and determined:\n- Risk Level: Low\n- Handoff Status: Not required\n- Justification: Common symptom without red flags\n- Generated safety guidance for inclusion in response\n\n## 3. Tool Orchestration\n- Evidence retrieval tools accessed basic headache treatment information\n- Limited evidence returned (mock data in this case)\n- No specialized medical tools needed due to low complexity\n\n## 4. Medical Reasoning Construction\nCanonical answer built through:\n1. Evidence synthesis of available data\n2. Structured into key components:\n   - Basic symptom information\n   - Treatment options (OTC medications)\n   - Non-medical interventions\n   - Safety warnings\n   - Follow-up questions\n3. Added standard medical disclaimers\n\n## 5. PharmaMiku Transformation\nPharmaMiku agent:\n- Maintained core medical information\n- Added friendly, accessible formatting\n- Incorporated:\n  - Kawaii personality elements\n  - Clear section headers\n  - Bullet-point structure\n  - Emoji usage\n  - Follow-up questions\n- Preserved all safety warnings\n- Added educational tone while maintaining medical accuracy\n\n## 6. Judge Agent Review\nFinal safety check performed:\n- Verified medical accuracy\n- Confirmed appropriate risk messaging\n- Checked for proper disclaimers\n- Validated citation inclusion\n- Assessed overall response safety\n- Verdict: \"SAFE\" - No modifications needed\n\n## Key Decision Points\n1. Low risk classification enabled automated response\n2. Limited evidence triggered generalized advice approach\n3. Follow-up questions included due to incomplete information\n4. Standard safety warnings maintained throughout\n5. PharmaMiku personality applied without compromising medical accuracy\n\nThis pipeline demonstrates balanced handling of:\n- Medical safety\n- Information accuracy\n- User engagement\n- Risk management\n- Professional standards\n\nThe system successfully delivered accurate medical information in an accessible format while maintaining appropriate safety protocols.",
