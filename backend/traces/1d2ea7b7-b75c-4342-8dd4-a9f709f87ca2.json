            "trace_explanation_user_friendly": "Here's how I'd explain the process to the user:\n\n\"When you asked about your headache, I first made sure this was something I could safely help with - like a pharmacy assistant checking if they can give advice or need to refer you to a doctor. Then, I looked up information from trusted medical sources (kind of like checking a reliable health reference book). Since headaches are a common concern that can usually be helped with over-the-counter medicine, I gathered the key points about treatment options and safety warnings. I then put everything into friendly, easy-to-understand language, making sure to include both helpful tips and important warnings about when to see a doctor. Think of it like having a caring pharmacy helper who wants to make sure you get clear, accurate information while staying safe!\"",
