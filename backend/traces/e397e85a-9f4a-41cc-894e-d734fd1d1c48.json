            "trace_explanation_user_friendly": "\"First, I checked if this was a question I could safely answer - and since you were asking about people rather than medical advice, I knew it was okay to help! I searched through several trusted sources, kind of like looking through multiple encyclopedias, to find accurate information about people named Pratik Rai. I found two main people with this name - one who teaches at a university and another who's a fighter. To make it helpful for you, I organized the information like a friendly introduction to each person, making sure to include the most interesting and important facts about both. Think of it like introducing two people at a party - you want to share the most relevant things about them! I made sure to include reliable sources where you could learn more if you wanted to.\"",
