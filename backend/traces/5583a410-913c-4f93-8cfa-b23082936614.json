            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air... | \u201d |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n## Overview edit\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened.

The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

According to the wiki the body section needs the following:> Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each> Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completionI've done the jars but I think I forgot the mummy hand. However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete!

Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one).

I looted the skeletons and the wiki says i should get 4 items including a mummy hand, im positive i got no mummy hand and i cant reloot the bodies anymore and if i go back in there are no more bodies to loot. I am now at the point where i have a mummy with no hand, how do i get the hand to get 100% completion at this point?EDIT: My base assumption is i missed a skeleton the first time around, i cant rummage any of the skeletons anymore so how can i get the item, there has to be a way otherwise I'm permanently prevented from any further quests up the line?\n\n**Answer:**\nIf I needed to contact Jagex for support how would I go about doing that?\n\n*Upvotes: 1*\n\n[5] Missing My Mummy - The RuneScape Wiki\nURL: https://runescape.wiki/w/Missing_My_Mummy?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n# Missing My Mummy\n\n|   | This article has a quick guide.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife.

of the Mahjarrat series although it is mainly a desert quest. It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes. Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air...\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Member requirement | Members only |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official difficulty | Intermediate |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official length | Medium to Long |\n| --- | --- |\n| Requirements | Skill requirements are not boostable unless marked with a [B] for boostable.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands\n\n[8] Missing My Mummy -

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

According to the wiki the body section needs the following:> Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each> Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completionI've done the jars but I think I forgot the mummy hand. However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*\n\n[10] r/runescape on Reddit: Cannot complete missing my mummy\nURL: https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/75yjn9/cannot_complete_missing_my_mummy/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n**Question:**\nI was doing missing my mummy and killing the skeleton looters. None of them dropped the scroll of the dead and I can no longer fight them again, making it uncompletable. Help please.\n\n**Answer:**\nThanks for the advice all.

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer.

Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes. Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air...\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Member requirement | Members only |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official difficulty | Intermediate |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official length | Medium to Long |\n| --- | --- |\n| Requirements | Skill requirements are not boostable unless marked with a [B] for boostable.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot.

Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer.

Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes. Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air...\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Member requirement | Members only |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official difficulty | Intermediate |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official length | Medium to Long |\n| --- | --- |\n| Requirements | Skill requirements are not boostable unless marked with a [B] for boostable.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes. Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air...\n\n## Walkthrough\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Member requirement | Members only |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official difficulty | Intermediate |\n| --- | --- |\n| Official length | Medium to Long |\n| --- | --- |\n| Requirements | Skill requirements are not boostable unless marked with a [B] for boostable.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer.

Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer.

Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened. Please check back tomorrow.\"\n\n- The items that are found inside the pyramid are from AMCE, a pun on the fictional\n\nACME company in the cartoon series\n\n. The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, for the quest \"Missing My Mummy\", if you can't find the mummy hand or can't rummage the skeletons anymore, here are the key solutions:\n\n1. Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes. Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air... | \u201d |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n## Overview edit\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink - spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus - 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it - 1/6, 4% completion\n\n#### Name\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name - 2/2, 8% completion\n\n#### Personality\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was - 1/1, 4% completion\n\nYou should now have 100% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\n## Rewards\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- lamp\n\n- Access to the Amascut altar in the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys and 2 Hearts of Ice\n\nExperience earned while completing the mummy:\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievement\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) - Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n## Required for completing\n\nCompletion of Missing My Mummy is required for the following:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Senliten has to be restored to 100% for the following quests: The Curse of Arrav Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- The Curse of Arrav\n\n- Do No Evil (you must also lead Leela to Senliten's tomb)\n\n- Desert Tasks: Medium: \"Overcut\" Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n- Medium: \"Overcut\"\n\n- Elite: \"Sun Shade\" (Tumeken's shadows need to be killed in a special match in the Dominion Tower)\n\n## Transcript\n\n## Trivia\n\n- On the day of release, the spoiler read: \"As one might expect, the rewards are a mystery, even to the enlightened.

The acronym \"AMCE\" stands for \"Ali Morrisane Commercial Enterprises\", as seen in the lift manual for the scaffolding device in Royal Trouble.\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMissing My Mummy |\n| --- |\n| Part 8 of the Desert quest series |\n| NPCs | Leela Golem's remains Ali Morrisane Ali the Engineer Ali the Shovel Ali the Egghead Senliten Ali the Leaflet Dropper |\n| Enemies | Skeleton looter Golem guard Bandit looter Tumeken's shadow Small scarab |\n| Items | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummyCanopic jars Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles | Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy | Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n| Rewards | Constitution XP lamp |\n| Locations | Uzer Mastaba |\n| Music | Kharidian Nights Ancestral Wisdom The Plundered Tomb |\n| Miscellaneous | Quick guide \u2022 Transcript |\n\n- Ali the Engineer\n\n- Ali the Shovel\n\n- Ali the Egghead\n\n- Skeleton looter\n\n- Bandit looter\n\n- Tumeken's shadow\n\n- Small scarab\n\n| Scroll of the dead Pyramid journal Mummy hand Useless ration boxes Tatty bag Defective spades Shattered axes Sub-optimal lantern Suboptimal flask Al kharid flyer Spiced wine Pot of wheat Copied name papyrus Mummy's name papyrus Scroll of praise Mummy with no hand Senliten's mummy |\n| --- |\n| Canopic jars | Spleen Elbow marrow Pancreatic bile Tongue follicles |\n\n- Scroll of the dead\n\n- Pyramid journal\n\n- Mummy hand\n\n- Useless ration boxes\n\n- Tatty bag\n\n- Defective spades\n\n- Shattered axes\n\n- Sub-optimal lantern\n\n- Suboptimal flask\n\n- Al kharid flyer\n\n- Spiced wine\n\n- Pot of wheat\n\n- Copied name papyrus\n\n- Mummy's name papyrus\n\n- Scroll of praise\n\n- Mummy with no hand\n\n- Senliten's mummy\n\n- Spleen\n\n- Elbow marrow\n\n- Pancreatic bile\n\n- Tongue follicles\n\n- Constitution XP lamp\n\n- Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eMahjarrat quest series |\n| --- |\n| Mysteries of the Mahjarrat |   |\n| Rise of Lucien |   |\n| Return of Zaros | Main Related | Main |   | Related |   |\n| Main |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Arrav |   |\n| Sliske |   |\n| Related quests |   |\n| Related miniquests | The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars |\n| Lores and Histories | The Fall of Six The Legend of Arrav Twice Burnt Roots in the Community |\n| Quest recollector | Ali the Wise |\n\n| Main |   |\n| --- | --- |\n| Related |   |\n\n- The Curse of Zaros The General's Shadow Nadir Koschei's Troubles Mahjarrat Memories Tales of the God Wars\n\n| v \u2022 d \u2022 eDesert quest series |\n| --- |\n| Main series |   |\n| Related |   |\n| Former |   |\n| Quest recollector | Khoochak |\n\n- Khoochak\n\n- Intermediate quests\n\n- Quests\n\n- Missing My Mummy\n\n- Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Desert quests\n\n- Mysteries of the Mahjarrat quest series\n\n- Fantasy\n\n- RuneScape\n\n- Suomi\n\n- Nederlands"

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

However, I can't get it from the skeleton looters. When I try to rummage them nothing happens, even the examine option doesn't work.Anyone know what's up? I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

Since I'm trained to help with health and medicine questions (like a pharmacy counter helper), I knew the right thing to do was to explain that I couldn't give gaming advice and offer to either connect you with someone who could help with the game, or help you with any medical questions instead.

Location of mummy hand:\n- Primary source: Dropped by skeleton looters inside the pyramid\n- Backup location: Can be found in the hallway near where you killed the golem if lost/destroyed\n\n2. If you can't rummage skeletons anymore:\n- You may need to walk across the puzzle floor again to reset/access certain areas\n- Look specifically in the hallway by the golem guardian\n- Check behind wall traps (need to disable with Thieving skill)\n\n3. Key tips:\n- The three clustered skeletons in the west room will all attack at once after rummaging one, so be prepared\n- Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill skeletons more efficiently\n- Remember to disable wall traps by searching odd markings before entering alcoves\n\n4. Important cautions:\n- Save inventory space by gathering all required items together\n- Don't destroy important quest items as they may be hard to recover\n- If you log out inside the pyramid, you will appear outside upon login\n\nIf you're still unable to find the mummy hand after checking these locations, you may need to:\n1. Verify you have the correct quest requirements\n2. Check if any game updates have affected the quest\n3. Consider submitting a bug report if the issue persists\n\nBased on the evidence, there appear to be some documented cases of players having similar issues, suggesting this may be a known game bug. You may want to try logging out and back in, or completing other quests and returning later to see if it resolves itself.",

Walk just north-east and speak with Leela. She talks about an old pyramid near Uzer and wants you to go investigate. She also allows you to enter the pyramid without being cursed.\n\nScouting out the Pyramid Items Required: None Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, Waterskins, and food\n\n2. Proceed to Al-Kharid and take a carpet ride to the ruins of Uzer. From there, walk south to the Pyramid. Players who have access to Fairy Rings can use the Fairy Ring code DLQ for an even quicker option.\n\n3. Upon entry, rummage through and defeat the skeletons you see on the ground until you have the following items: Canopic jar, Pyramid journal, Mummy hand, Scroll of the dead. Note that there is one skeleton behind a wall trap that you may want to disarm with thieving.\n\n4. After you have the items, you should get a message to return to Leela. Teleport back to Draynor Village and speak with Leela.\n\nReturning to the Pyramid Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Empty Pot, Wheat (add to the Empty Pot now to create a Pot of wheat), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: 205 coins or Dramen/Lunar staff, Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon with a crush attack style, Waterskins, a Prayer potion (if below 74 prayer), and food\n\n5. After you have all the required items, go back to the pyramid and go through the stone door in the north-west corner. Unless you have a weapon with a crush option, take off your weapon and defeat the Golem guard, then go down the stairs.\n\n6. While being wary of the nearby scarabs, pick up the Canopic jars so that you should now have four. While picking up the canopic jars, go through the hole in the wall to the east, walk slightly south, and climb back through a hole. This should open up a very useful shortcut for later.\n\n7. Near the far south-east wall, you will also find a mummy without a hand. Pick it up and use the Mummy hand in your inventory with the mummy.\n\n8. Return near the entrance, where you should see a multi-coloured tiled floor. The trick to safely walking across here is to only walk on either red and yellow tiles or blue and green tiles all the way across, or else you will take damage and may not be able to pass.\n\nNext, you will find yourself in a room with a sarcophagus and lots of other items scattered about.\n\nBringing the Queen Back Items Required: 20 Fire runes, Jug of wine, Willow logs, Spice, Pot of wheat, a Prayer potion (if below 70 prayer), the items previously collected in the pyramid Items Suggested: Amulet of Glory, armour, a decent weapon, and food\n\n9. Put the mummy in the sarcophagus and pray to all the destroyed statues. If you cannot pray to a certain statue, don't worry about it for now... you just won't get 100% completion of the Queen but can still complete the quest.\n\n10. Next, use your spice with the jug of wine and replace the broken jug with your wine. You should also be able to replace the nearby broken pot with your Pot of grain. Repair the broken chair and table, then add the four Canopic jars to the shelves to the west. Now you are ready to bring her spirit back!\n\n11. Move east and kill Tumiken's shadow. Light the south lamp. Kill the shadow again and light the north lamp. Next is west, and again, kill the shadow. Finally light the east lamp and kill the shadow.\n\n12. Now return to the sarcophagus and you should see the Queen standing by it. Speak with her and then build a Willow statue on the nearby spot. If you can, carve the statue a few times to receive extra experience.\n\n13. The Queen will now acknowledge that you have done enough and can return to Leela. Teleport to Draynor Village and speak with Leela. Quest complete! Kind of...\n\n### Reward\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- 7,000 Constitution XP\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys\n\nQuest points: 1\n\nThis quest is a requirement for:\n\n- Crocodile Tears\n\n- Curse of Arrav, The\n\n- Do No Evil\n\n### Tips, Tricks & Notes\n\n- You receive a total of 6,500 Prayer XP for repairing all of the destroyed statues.\n\n- You receive a total of 2,100 Construction XP for repairing the table and chair.\n\n- You receive a total of 5,000 Magic XP for killing all the Shadows.\n\n- You receive a total of 3,350 Crafting XP from creating the willow statue and completely carving it.\n\n- You receive 2,100 Cooking XP for putting the Pot of grain in place.\n\n- After you have finished repairing all destroyed statues you can pray at them to restore your prayer. If you pray at the Amascut statue your Prayer level will be boosted anywhere from 1 to 4 levels, but by doing so you will lose some LP. The amount of damage is random but no damage is over 200 LP.\n\nAfter completing the quest, you can continue to add to the percentage of the Queen's completion until you reach 100%. This completion is a mini-quest in itself.\n\n| Mummy Restoration Mini-Quest Hide/Show: |\n| --- |\n\nQuests: Garden of Tranquility\n\nSkills: Level 45 Crafting, Level 50 Magic, Level 50 Prayer, Level 25 Thieving\n\nItems: Ring of charos (a), Pestle and mortar\n\n1. Speak with Ali Morrisane in Al-Kharid. He tells you that Reldo (the Varrock librarian) has some important documents pertaining to the Queen and will ask for some sq'irk juice* in exchange for his documents regarding her name, and he can give you more if you have superhuman convincing powers. Go get some sq'irk juice (any type works) and return to Ali Morrisane. You will need to collect sq'irk fruits from the same garden from the Sorceress's Garden Minigame and use them with your Pestle and mortar to put into a Beer glass (search the shelves in the Sorceress's house for one). He will give you the Copied name papyrus. Next, equip your Ring of charos(a) and speak with him to get the real mummy's name papyrus. With the Mummy's name papyrus in hand, walk north towards the Al Kharid mine.\n\n2. Pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the leaflet dropper just north of the Al Kharid mine. Proceed to Varrock castle after you have the flyer.\n\n3. Speak with Reldo, who will ask for a flyer from Ali Morrisane. Give him the flyer and he will give you a scroll of praise in return.\n\n4. Go back to the Queen using the same routes you followed earlier. Now you should have 100% completion and some extra experience. Congratulations!\n\n*You can receive up to 3,000 Thieving XP from giving Ali Morrisane Sq'irk Juice, the worse the juice the less XP you receive.\n\n### Credits\n\nWritten by: Lalala7324 Special thanks to: Blood666bag Thanks to: Baffler, Brainymidget, Codguy, Ddraiggoch06, DoomedMages, Errdoth, essiw, flares_dad, Gedderz, Howlin1, Ibcrootbeer, Jaffy1, jcube69, kingmickez25, Lord_Bunkie, morrowindgek, N_odie, Nyosuht, Pokemama, Shasta_Sms, SmokeDAS, SportsGuy, swphoenix, sydwinder14, Water, Zaaps1\n\nLast updated: 10-May-2014\n\n| RuneScape 2007 |\n| --- |\n| Find this page on the Internet Archive with a date as close to Aug 10, 2007 as possible. |\n\n## Search\n\n## Poll\n\nWill you use Menaphos to train your skills?\n\n\u00bb View poll archive \u00ab\n\n## Circus & Penguins\n\nCircus: Edgeville\n\n\u00bb View penguin locations \u00ab\n\n## Link to Us\n\nAdd a Tip.It button to your web site:\n\n## Follow Us\n\nFollow @RuneTips\n\nFollow @TipItCrew\n\nFollow @TipItEvents\n\nReturn to top\n\n- Databases\n\n###### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides\n\n###### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools\n\n###### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas\n\n###### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info\n\n###### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities\n\n- Databases \u203a Bestiary \u203a NPCs \u203a Items \u203a Quests \u203a Shops\n\n### Databases\n\n- \u203a Bestiary\n\n- \u203a NPCs\n\n- \u203a Items\n\n- \u203a Quests\n\n- \u203a Shops\n\n- Guides \u203a Skill Guides \u203a General Guides \u203a Minigame Guides \u203a Task Guides \u203a Guild Guides \u203a Monster Hunting \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n### Guides\n\n- \u203a Skill Guides\n\n- \u203a General Guides\n\n- \u203a Minigame Guides\n\n- \u203a Task Guides\n\n- \u203a Guild Guides\n\n- \u203a Monster Hunting\n\n- \u203a Treasure Trails\n\n- Tools \u203a Skill Calculators \u203a Skill Planners \u203a Special Calcs \u203a Signatures \u203a GE Centre \u203a DGSweeper \u203a RuneScript\n\n### Tools\n\n- \u203a Skill Calculators\n\n- \u203a Skill Planners\n\n- \u203a Special Calcs\n\n- \u203a Signatures\n\n- \u203a GE Centre\n\n- \u203a DGSweeper\n\n- \u203a RuneScript\n\n- Atlas \u203a World & Wild \u203a Dungeon Maps \u203a Special Maps \u203a Mining Sites \u203a Hunting Locations \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n### Atlas\n\n- \u203a World & Wild\n\n- \u203a Dungeon Maps\n\n- \u203a Special Maps\n\n- \u203a Mining Sites\n\n- \u203a Hunting Locations\n\n- \u203a Fairy Ring Map\n\n- Info \u203a Beginner's Guide \u203a Skill & Data Tables \u203a New P2P Members \u203a Activities\n\n### Info\n\n- \u203a Beginner's Guide\n\n- \u203a Skill & Data Tables\n\n- \u203a New P2P Members\n\n- \u203a Activities"

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Official description edit\n\n| \u201c | The desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes. Leela, Osman's agent in Draynor, has heard that a new pyramid has been unearthed, and that secrets from the days before the God Wars may well be due some time in the open air... | \u201d |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n\n## Overview edit\n\n| Start point | Speak to Leela in Draynor Village.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest. A pyramid journal can also be obtained from the skeleton directly north of the exit to Uzer, although this item is not required for the quest nor restoring Senliten to 100% completion.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Use area-of-effect abilities like Cleave to kill the skeletons more quickly. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all three items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you study them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n## Embalming tools edit\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb was frequently raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n### Full completion edit\n\nThe following two subsections only need to be completed if the player wishes to restore the queen to 100% completion, which is needed to continue the Desert quest series and start The Curse of Arrav. The quest only requires the queen to be 75% complete, but there are further experience rewards for full completion. These steps can be skipped at this time, and returning later to complete them when the need arises.\n\n#### The name edit\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace north of the lodestone, near the silk trader. Ask him about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba, and he will explain that he sent the bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give away.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the apprentice to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document \u2013 the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality edit\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Waseem the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n## The mummy edit\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into Senliten's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. You may be placed in the mummy's tomb after descending the stairs, past the puzzle. If so, you will need to cross the puzzle backwards to complete the rest of this section. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. On the same wall where you come in at to the south, there is another uninviting hole. Climbing through it unblocks a shortcut to/from the upper level of the tomb near the entrance and completes the achievement Uzer Master, required for the master quest cape. This room contains nothing else of interest. Climb back through the \"cave in\" and then through the northern hole to return to the lower level.\n\n## Tomb traps edit\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber of the lowest level. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\nFrom the starting point, walking to any tile will cause no damage, although another type of blocks will rise and block your way. This rising mechanism will continue until you reach the end.\n\n| Walk to |   | Raise |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Red blocks |\n|   | Red title |   | Green blocks |\n|   | Green tile |   | Yellow blocks |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Blue tile |\n\nIf you walk from one tile to another, you may either trigger a traps and take damage, or be safe, depending on which type of tile you talk to.\n\n| Step from |   | Walk to |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Take damage |   | Be safe |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |\n|   | Red title |   | Blue tile |   | Yellow tile |\n|   | Green tile |   | Red tile |   | Blue tile |\n|   | Yellow tile |   | Green tile |   | Red tile |\n\n## Senliten edit\n\nCheck progress via the pyramid journal or the scroll of the dead. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n### Body edit\n\nComponents of Senliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west \u2013 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking the \"Fill\" option on the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 8% completion\n\nIt is also possible to add the parts to the sarcophagus individually without assembling the whole mummy.\n\n### Spirit edit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points \u2013 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's statue will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the medium Desert achievements, Overcut. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n### Shadow edit\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four enchanted sconces using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for 600 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for 900 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce, requiring level 40 . The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for 1,200 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for 2,000 experience \u2013 1/5, 4% completion\n\n### Body double edit\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus. You need to create her body double using her image.\n\nCreating a body double for the queen provides a replacement for her in the afterlife. The food and drinks are symbolised by the wheat in clay pots and the traditional drink \u2013 spiced wine.\n\n- Repair the table and chair \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Replace the spiced wine and pot of wheat by clicking on their respective positions near the sarcophagus \u2013 2/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Create the ushabti from the willow log by clicking on the empty statue base \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to carve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n- Click on the statue to improve it \u2013 1/6, 4% completion\n\n### Name edit\n\n- Give the mummy's name papyrus to the Pharaoh Queen to make her remember her full name \u2013 2/2, 8% completion\n\n### Personality edit\n\n- Give the scroll of praise to the Pharaoh Queen, and she will remember who she was \u2013 1/1, 4% completion\n\n## Finishing up edit\n\nYou should now have at least 75% completion. Go back and speak to Leela.\n\nCongratulations, quest complete!\n\nIt is important to 100% restore Senliten. This is a requirement for the quests Crocodile Tears, Do No Evil, and The Curse of Arrav.\n\n## Rewards edit\n\n- 1 quest point\n\n- 7,000 experience lamp\n\n- 5,000 coins\n\n- Access to the Amascut statue in Senliten's tomb, giving extra prayer points at the cost of some life points.\n\n- 2 Treasure Hunter keys (Ironman accounts will not receive these)\n\n- Experience earned while completing the mummy: 2,100 experience 2,100 experience 5,000 experience 6,500 experience 3,350 experience 3,000 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 2,100 experience\n\n- 5,000 experience\n\n- 6,500 experience\n\n- 3,350 experience\n\n- 3,000 experience\n\n- Ability to clear the shortcut found in the Uzer Mastaba\n\n- Kharidian Nights\n\n- Ancestral Wisdom\n\n- The Plundered Tomb\n\n## Achievements edit\n\n- Missing My Mummy ( 0) \u2013 Complete this quest.\n\n- Uzer Master ( 10) \u2013 Clear the shortcut path in the Uzer Mastaba.\n\n- Desert achievements Medium - Overcut ( 10) \u2013 Boost your stats at Amascut's altar.

It does, however, provide insight into the history of the Mahjarrat tribe. The quest revolves around the restoration of Queen Senliten, a pharaoh from the Second Age.\n\n## Contents\n\n- 1 Official description\n\n- 2 Walkthrough 2.1 Pharaoh Queen 2.2 The cursed mastaba 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality 2.4 The mummy 2.5 Tomb traps 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.1 Pharaoh Queen\n\n- 2.2 The cursed mastaba\n\n- 2.3 Embalming tools 2.3.1 The name 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.3.1 The name\n\n- 2.3.2 Her personality\n\n- 2.4 The mummy\n\n- 2.5 Tomb traps\n\n- 2.6 Senliten 2.6.1 Body 2.6.2 Spirit 2.6.3 Shadow 2.6.4 Body double 2.6.5 Name 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 2.6.1 Body\n\n- 2.6.2 Spirit\n\n- 2.6.3 Shadow\n\n- 2.6.4 Body double\n\n- 2.6.5 Name\n\n- 2.6.6 Personality\n\n- 3 Rewards\n\n- 4 Achievement\n\n- 5 Required for completing\n\n- 6 Transcript\n\n- 7 Trivia\n\n## Official description\n\nThe desert sands rarely offer up their treasures, but when they do it is sure to be of interest to those with pure intentions and those with gold in their eyes.

They will rise up and turn into level 42 Skeleton looters, becoming aggressive. Killing each one will provide different items, including desert shirts, empty waterskins, tools or runes which you may pick up.\n\nThe item that Leela requires is the scroll of the dead, which details the mummification process that was used on the queen. Other items needed from the skeleton looters are a canopic jar, a pyramid journal and a mummy hand. These items are not needed immediately, but it is suggested to keep them for later on in the quest.\n\nThe three clustered skeletons in the west room just after the stone door will all spring awake after rummaging one and attack you all at once, so be prepared for an outnumbered fight. Also, before entering the alcove in the far north-east, disable a wall trap by searching the odd markings, or you will take damage from the spikes it conceals. You may fail disabling it, however. Gather all four items to save inventory space in the next section.\n\nTalking to the Golem's remains in the eastern cavern reveals that there is a curse upon the mastaba, under which all creatures who loot the tomb will be bound to it, to protect it from future looters. He also mentions that the queen, her family and their direct employees and also those without flesh are immune to the effects of this curse.\n\nNone of the items found on the ground (useless ration boxes, tatty bag, defective spades, shattered axes, sub-optimal lantern, and suboptimal flask) are needed to complete the quest, but it's helpful if you investigate them so you can confront Ali Morrisane later.\n\n### Embalming tools\n\nReturn to Draynor Village and talk to Leela again, who mentions that the mummy was split up as part of burial rituals, and also that the tomb frequently was raided. Therefore, you must now reconstruct the queen to at least 75% of her original self.\n\nAfter having spoken to Leela about all the four items that you obtained from the looters, you will now be able to make both spiced wine and a pot of wheat, required for the revival of the queen. To make the wine, use the spice on your jug of wine, and to make the pot of wheat, simply use the wheat on an empty pot.\n\n#### The name\n\nTravel to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace about the various defective items that you found in the mastaba. He will explain that he sent the Bandit looters to get treasure from the pyramid, but they returned with just documents, which no one can persuade him to give\n\naway.\n\nGive him any sq'irkjuice obtained from the Sorceress's Garden minigame. If it's your first time getting the juice, talk to Osman in the palace about the juice, and then simply encourage the Apprentice, located North-East of Shantay Pass, to vent to you about working for the sorceress and she'll teleport you to the garden. Exchange the juice with Ali for a copied name papyrus. You will receive the usual thieving experience you would get from Osman. Then wear your ring of charos (a) and talk to Ali Morrisane again to persuade him to give you the original document - the mummy's name papyrus. You find out that the queen's true name is Senliten.\n\n#### Her personality\n\nTalk to him again about the tomb. The documents that he had obtained from his looters have been sold off to various buyers, most prominently Reldo, the Varrock palace librarian. Before going to Varrock, if you don't already have one, pick up a flier from Ali the Leaflet Dropper, north of the Al Kharid mining site.\n\nReldo tells you that he did buy some scrolls off Ali, but they are incomplete. He promises to hand over the originals once he has copied the complete form. He also says that Ali is cleaning the papyrus and re-using them as fliers. Give him an Al Kharid flyer, to which he notices that Ali has been using a cheap cleaning agent, and that the text can still be imposed for copying. After he is done, you will receive a scroll of praise.\n\n### The mummy\n\nMake sure you have full prayer points and head back to the mastaba. Inside the Uzer Mastaba, head north-west, open the imposing door, and talk to the Golem Guard at the stairs. He will keep saying 'Halt!' and prevent you entry into the Pharaoh Queen's tomb, so you will have to kill him. You will not have to kill him a second time to access the lower level again.\n\nDescend to the lower level. There are level 42 small scarabs wandering around that are aggressive regardless of your combat level, although quite inaccurate. Do not head directly south yet, but go down each passage to the west and east and collect the three canopic jars and the mummy with no hand. Using the mummy hand on the mummy magically grafts it together, thus re-forming Senliten's mummy.\n\nIn the south-easternmost passage, climb through the uninviting hole to access a large room filled with another large group of small scarabs. Nearby, to the south, there is another uninviting hole. If you climb through it, you will come out at the cave-in in the upper level, allowing you easier access to the lower level for later visits.\n\n### Tomb traps\n\nAfter you have obtained the jars and the mummy, enter the central chamber. You will find yourself before a floor puzzle. The puzzle is different for every player and changes with every visit.\n\nThe easiest way to get through this puzzle is to find a path of blue and green blocks or of red and yellow blocks all the way through, as this will result in no damage, or you can tank your way through it if you bring enough food. It is not necessary to take a straight path, as you can make turns through the puzzle.\n\n| Stepping on a... | ...blue stone raises the red tiles | No damage, although can block your path. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red stone raises the green tiles |\n| ...green stone raises the yellow tiles |\n| ...yellow stone raises the blue tiles |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to red... | ...triggers a trap. Players will take damage. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to blue... |\n| ...blue to yellow... |\n| ...yellow to green... |\n\n| Stepping from... | ...green to blue... | ... does nothing and therefore is safe. |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| ...red to yellow... |\n| ...blue to green... |\n| ...yellow to red... |\n\n### Senliten\n\nCheck-progress via the pyramid Journal or the scroll of the dead, by right-clicking on either. You need to revive various aspects of Senliten \u2014 her body, spirit, shadow, ushabti (body double), name and personality. The interface shows the percentage of completed actions and remaining actions. The quest completion requires 75% complete, though continuing beyond that rewards more experience. 100% is required for The Curse of Arrav quest, so make sure that you complete Senliten.\n\n#### Body\n\nSenliten's body must be replaced to their positions, including the canopic jars and her mummified body.\n\n- Place all four canopic jars containing the organs onto the empty shelves to the west - 4/6, 4% completion each\n\n- Replace Senliten's mummy by clicking on the sarcophagus - 2/6, 8% completion\n\n#### Spirit\n\nSenliten tells you that restoring each statue ensures that she is linked to all the other deities of the land.\n\n- Pray at each of the 'Broken statues' to restore them. Restoring each statue drains about 0\u2013200 prayer points - 5/5, 4% completion each\n\n- You may run out of prayer points, so it is best to have some prayer potions in your inventory, as you cannot pray at any statue until all of them are restored. You may otherwise have to run to a nearby bank, or the nearest altar, which is in Sophanem.\n\nPraying at Amascut's altar will boost your prayer by up to 40 points over your maximum, at the cost of 3 life points per prayer point; the other altars restore prayer normally. This is also one of the tasks in the Desert Tasks. Note that you cannot recharge prayer points from the statues until all of them are remade.\n\n#### Shadow\n\n- Go into the eastern chamber and kill the level 42 Tumeken's shadow. - 1/5, 4% completion\n\nYou now need to light four 'Enchanted sconces' using 5 fire runes as fuel for each.\n\n- Light the southern enchanted sconce, requiring 20 . Tumeken's shadow appears again, with a combat level of 49. Kill the shadow for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the northern enchanted sconce, requiring level 25 . The shadow, now level 56, appears again. Kill it again for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Light the western enchanted sconce. The shadow will spawn again, this time as a level 63. Kill it for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n- Finally, light the eastern enchanted sconce, requiring level 50 . Tumeken's shadow appears for the last time, being level 70. Kill it one last time for - 1/5, 4% completion\n\n#### Body double\n\nAfter reconstructing the queen's body, spirit and shadow, she can now be found standing at the base of her sarcophagus.

She will ask you to locate a Pharaoh Queen in the Desert of Uzer. Note: The easiest way to reach Draynor Village is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Make your way to the Shantay Pass south of Al Kharid and enter the desert. Take a carpet ride for a fee of 200 Coins to the Ruins of Uzer in the eastern part of the desert. Once you have reached the ruins, head south to a pyramid and enter it. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid. At any point, if you log out when you are inside of the pyramid you will appear outside of the pyramid.\n\n- Once inside, \"Rummage\" the skeletons laying on the ground. They will turn into a Skeleton looter (level 42) and start attacking you. Defeat these skeletons until you have obtained a Canopic jar and a Pyramid journal. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest. Inside the pyramid, you may also come across a wall trap. Use your Thieving skills to disable it. Note: If you did not bring a Hammer, a Saw, or 20 Fire runes, then keep killing the Skeleton looters (level 42) inside of the pyramid and the Bandit looters (level 42) outside of the pyramid until they drop them.\n\n- Head to the northwestern part of the pyramid and open the imposing doors. Continue to rummage and kill some more Skeleton looters (level 42) until you get a Scroll of the dead and a Mummy hand. You do not need to pick up any of the other items they drop as they have no use in the quest.\n\n- Read the Scroll of the dead and Pyramid journal before you report back to Leela in Draynor Village. She will explain that a ritual has been performed on the Pharaoh Queen to split her mummy into pieces. It is your task to partially (75%) reconstruct her by restoring a certain number of the Pharaoh Queen's parts (100% is recommended. These parts include her name, shadow, spirit, body, personality, and body double.\n\n- Make your way to Al Kharid and talk to Ali Morrisane in the marketplace in north-eastern part of Al Kharid not far from the cactus patch. He will tell you that he has a copy of the documents with the Pharaoh Queen's name. He would be happy to hand it over to you if you give him a glass of Sq'irkjuice, so that he can sell it to Osman. Give him the Sq'irkjuice in exchange for the Copied name papyrus. Note: If you are wearing the Ring of charos (a), then talk to Ali again and he will also give you the original Mummy's name papyrus. The easiest way to reach Al Kharid is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- If you have not got one already, then pick up an Al kharid flyer from Ali the Leaflet Dropper who is located north of the Al Kharid mine. Head north to Varrock. Talk to Reldo at the Varrock Palace library about a pyramid. He is willing to give you his documents if you bring him an Al kharid flyer to verify their authenticity. Give him the flyer in exchange for the Scroll of praise. Note: The easiest way to reach Varrock is via the home teleport lodestone network.\n\n- Stop by the bank and gather the rest of the items you need to complete the quest (Hammer, Saw, Wheat, Spice, Jug of wine, 20 Fire runes, Willow logs, Knife).Return to the pyramid and open the imposing doors again. Kill the Golem guard (level 37) guarding the stairs at the back of the room. Note: The easiest way to reach Ruins of Uzer is via Fairy Ring code D L Q. From the Fairy Ring, head east to the pyramid.\n\n- Once defeated, go down the stairs and take the southeast fork until you find a Mummy with no hand. Pick up the Mummy with no hand and use the Mummy hand with the corpse to create Senliten's mummy.\n\n- Enter the uninviting hole just northeast of the body, then go through another hole a few steps to the south. You will have cleared the cave-in to create a shortcut for future use. Go back through both uninviting holes. Now, pick up the 3 Canopic jars, scattered throughout the cavern.\n\n- Once you have collected those, head south past the stairs to the tiled floor. To get across the puzzle, you will need to step on the tiles. As you step on a certain colored tile, it will cause another color to rise and block your path. The easiest way across is to only step on the green and blue tiles OR the yellow and red tiles. Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise. Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise. Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise. Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap. Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap. Note: If you trigger a trap, you will lose up to 20% of your total life points.\n\n- Stepping on a red tile causes the green tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a green tile causes the yellow tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping on a yellow tile causes the blue tiles to rise.\n\n- Stepping from a green tile onto a red tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a red tile onto a blue tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a yellow tile onto a green tile triggers a trap.\n\n- Stepping from a blue tile onto a yellow triggers a trap.\n\n- When you have made it across the puzzle, you must start restoring the Pharaoh Queen. You may do the steps in any order. When you have killed the 5 different levels of Tumeken's Shadow the Pharaoh Queen will appear near of her sarcophagus and you will be able to speak to her. When she is more than 75 % complete you may return to Leela in Draynor Village to complete the quest. Restore her to 100 % complete to gain all the extra experience rewards available from the different tasks. Note: Use the check progress option on the Pyramid journal or the Scroll of the dead to see how much progress you have made to restoring the mummy during the remainder of the quest.\n\n- Now that you are inside of the Pharaoh Queen's burial chamber, head over to the western side of the room and place all the 4 Canopic jars on the shelves. Note: If you log out at any point in the burial chamber and have cleared out the cave-in, then you will appear in the scarab cavern if you log in.\n\n- Go to the sarcophagus in the center of the chamber and click on it to return Senliten's mummy to its resting place.\n\n- Using the Hammer and Saw repair the broken table and chair in front of the sarcophagus.\n\n- Now, use the Spice with the Jug of wine to produce Spiced wine. Then, use the Wheat on the Empty pot to receive a Pot of wheat. Go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and replace the broken pot and jug with both items.\n\n- Head up the eastern stairs to the east to find 4 enchanted sconces in the wall, a wandering Tumeken's Shadow and a statue. Kill the Tumeken's Shadow and then click on one of the sconces to light it using 5 Fire runes. Only one sconce can be lit at one time. After you light a sconce the Shadow regenerates but at a higher combat level. Light the next sconce using 5 Fire runes and kill the shadow again. Repeat this process until you have killed the 5th re-incarnation. Note: The order in which you have to light the sconces differs from player to player.\n\n- Now, head back to the burial chamber and repair each of the 5 statues inside the burial chamber by praying on them. This requires a total of 101 Prayer points. Once all 5 have been restored, you can will be able to restore your prayer points as if they were prayer altars. Note: Praying at the fixed statues restores Prayer points like another altar except for the statue of Amascut, which boosts your Prayer points above your Prayer level but with a hit to your Life points.\n\n- With a Knife and Willow logs go to the eastern side of the sarcophagus and start building the base of Senliten's statue on the statue area. Now, carve the statue a few more times to finish it up.\n\n- Talk to the Pharaoh Queen in front of the statue and ask her about how to restore her name and personality. If you have the Scroll of praise and the Copied name papyrus in your inventory, then she will take them and remember her name and who she is. Note: If you also have the original Mummy's name papyrus, you will need to talk to her again to give her the other papyrus.\n\n- Now that all the phases are complete, head back to Leela in Draynor Village to claim your reward.

I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/4nq0mw/cant_restore_the_senliten_to_begin_curse_of_arrav/) post by [u/idrinkdeer](/user/idrinkdeer/) with a similar problem but no solution.\n\n**Answer:**\nAre you 100% certain you've done all jars? I'm fairly certain you can only replace the mummy once it has the hand attached, which would give you 2/6 completion in one go. You're only missing 1/6, so I feel like it has to be a jar. I could be wrong, though.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"
