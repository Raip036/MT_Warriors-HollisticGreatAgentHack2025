Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting!

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s the first in a new Kiwi crime series, a thriller with surprising twists.\n\nHi there, I\u2019m your host Jenny Wheeler, and on Binge Reading today Catherine talks about her new character, Detective Inspector Nyree Bradshaw and her race against time to solve a murder where everyone has something to hide and no one is telling the truth.

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Without additional verified information, I cannot make claims about other aspects of her life or background.\n\nIt's worth noting that while multiple \"Nyree\" individuals appear in the sources, they appear to be different people sharing the same first name, which has origins in both Maori and Armenian languages meaning \"wetland/marsh flower\" and \"land of canyons\" respectively [4].",

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Without additional verified information, I cannot make claims about other aspects of her life or background.\n\nIt's worth noting that while multiple \"Nyree\" individuals appear in the sources, they appear to be different people sharing the same first name, which has origins in both Maori and Armenian languages meaning \"wetland/marsh flower\" and \"land of canyons\" respectively [4].",

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s the first in a new Kiwi crime series, a thriller with surprising twists.\n\nHi there, I\u2019m your host Jenny Wheeler, and on Binge Reading today Catherine talks about her new character, Detective Inspector Nyree Bradshaw and her race against time to solve a murder where everyone has something to hide and no one is telling the truth.

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.

Without additional verified information, I cannot make claims about other aspects of her life or background.\n\nIt's worth noting that while multiple \"Nyree\" individuals appear in the sources, they appear to be different people sharing the same first name, which has origins in both Maori and Armenian languages meaning \"wetland/marsh flower\" and \"land of canyons\" respectively [4].",

Feel free to add anything you know about the name!Meaning of the name Nyree: Maori Language: Wetland, marsh, swamp flower Armenian Language: Land of canyons, nation of rivers Hebrew Language: 'God was gracious, God has shown favor', variant form of the European name Anna.Origin of the name Nyree: Nyree is an anglicized version of the name Ngaire. This name derives from the Maori word ngaere (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). The name also referred to the marshland flowers that blossomed in Ngaere region of New Zealand. Alternatively, Nyree is also a variation of the Armenian name Nairi (or Nayiri). This name derives from the Assyrian word \u0546\u0561\u056b\u0580\u056b (Nairi) and referred to a respected confederation of tribes in the Armenian Highlands. In Assyrian, the word means \u201cland of canyons\u201d or \u201cland of rivers.\u201d Nairi went on to become a patriotic nickname for present-day Armenia.Symbolism of the name Nyree: Nyree originated as anglicized version of the name Ngaire (meaning \u201cwetland\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d). It is the name for both the terrain and the marshland flowers that still bloom in the Ngaere region of New Zealand. The symbol of Nyree is the flax traditionally produced from this swamp flower.\n\n**Answer:**\nInteresting! Thanks for all the info.\n\n*Upvotes: 2*"

It\u2019s great to have you with us.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you so much for having me. It\u2019s great to be there with you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: It\u2019s wonderful, almost a novelty to have a fellow New Zealander. I don\u2019t deliberately choose or not choose Kiwis. I choose people who fit the books we\u2019re doing, but it\u2019s lovely to have somebody who\u2019s writing those books in New Zealand.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. That\u2019s why I decided to write the books in New Zealand. I\u2019ve got some set in the States. When I started writing \u2013 I put my first book out in 2013 \u2013 somebody said, don\u2019t set them in New Zealand for goodness sake, nobody will ever read them. Set them in the States. So that\u2019s what I did.\n\nAnd of course, then the process began. I decided to set a politically based thriller and boy, their politics are quite different to ours. It was such a lot of research. I thought, you know what? I know far more about New Zealand. We have got such an amazing country, such diverse cultures, so much flavor, so much brilliance and the country is so beautiful. Why not set them here?\n\nJenny Wheeler: To backtrack a bit, you write thrillers with heart, as your website says, and you have done several international page-turners. We will get to those a little later on because they are worth talking about, but your latest book, the one we\u2019re focusing on because it has just come out, is called The Water\u2019s Dead. It\u2019s a police procedural set in the far north of New Zealand where you live.\n\n## Writing a police procedural a new game\n\nThat is a bit of a change for you, and it\u2019s good to get in right at the beginning and talk a little bit about why you it made that. Was it different writing a psychological thriller to a police procedural?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is a lot different because you\u2019re looking at your main character coming at a crime from a different angle. I had to do a lot of research on police procedure in New Zealand because it\u2019s quite different to procedure overseas in very subtle ways. We think that the police just do this job and get out there and drag in suspects, but the amount of background work that goes on that you never ever get to see is amazing.\n\nBut if you wrote a real police procedural \u2013 and I think most police would agree with this \u2013 it would be absolutely boring because they put so much work in that we never see.\n\nJenny Wheeler: So much need to follow procedure.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, whereas when you\u2019ve got an amateur sleuth they can make up their own rules. They can do whatever they want, but they are not a party to a lot of the information that the police have, so it\u2019s how you approach the story. It has got to hit all those notes and have something to say.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. It has been described as a New Zealand version of Vera Stanhope, referring to Ann Cleeves\u2019 bestselling British crime series, the popular TV show, Vera. Was Ann Cleeves any sort of inspiration to you or is that just serendipity that happened when somebody thought, oh gosh, this is like Vera.\n\n## Ann Cleeves\u2019 \u2018Vera\u2019 an inspiration\n\nCatherine Lea: I did think that. I thought, this is kind of like Vera in New Zealand. I was so influenced not just by Ann Cleeves, but by all the great British writers. Ruth Rendell I\u2019ve been reading those for years, Colin Dexter. A lot of them are police procedurals, and I love that.\n\nI love a lot of the American writers as well, but this could be likened to Ann Cleeves because I want to get that small town feel, the police dealing with all kinds of people, and bring in the feeling of the towns.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Your central character is a detective inspector called Nyree Bradshaw. She is a battle-hardened cop, she\u2019s experienced, she\u2019s working in a beautiful but impoverished region of New Zealand. Now, even that picture of New Zealand might clash a bit with people\u2019s general touristy ideas of New Zealand because it\u2019s a part of New Zealand the tourists probably wouldn\u2019t ever see.\n\nI\u2019m correcting that because you do have a couple of tourists who find a body, but they are not really part of the community, they\u2019re just passing through. Why did you choose this aspect of New Zealand to make as the background for it?\n\nCatherine Lea: It was a hard decision because I\u2019ve got to be honest, when I started writing it I thought, do I want my overseas readers to see that part of New Zealand, because we\u2019re clean, we\u2019re green, it\u2019s beautiful, the people are lovely. But it\u2019s really not a realistic picture of New Zealand. As you say, it\u2019s the tourist idea of New Zealand.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\nNever miss out on the hottest new authors, regular FREE BOOK OFFERS and Most Popular podcasts.\n\n## Making the New Zealand setting authentic\n\nI wanted to get the real New Zealand. I wanted New Zealanders to recognize themselves and their towns. A lot of towns go back in time a little bit. They haven\u2019t got traffic lights. The small towns have got that community that the big cities don\u2019t have, and I wanted to bring that in.\n\nAn example. I went over to a small town not long ago and next thing we had the Tribesmen come in, all on their motorbikes, all racing in. I thought, oh my goodness. They were waiting in line at a fish and chip shop and I thought, oh my God, I have to cut through the line. There was this young man, patched up, tattoos, and I said, excuse me, can I get past? Oh, sorry, ma\u2019am, sorry. I thought that is an aspect of some of the people you don\u2019t get. There\u2019s good and there\u2019s bad, and I wanted to give that feel of these are all people in a community.\n\nJenny Wheeler: The Tribesmen, for people who aren\u2019t so familiar with some of the local scenes \u2013 there is a gang scene in New Zealand, in rural and urban areas, that attracts the underprivileged young men into a kind of family environment. The Tribesmen are one of those. This community you deal with in The Water\u2019s Dead has a strong Maori element to it. There\u2019s a Maori community who are, unfortunately, in many rural areas, the poorest of the people living there, and they\u2019ve got all the vices and wants that poverty and lack of opportunity present.\n\n## The fun of on-the-ground research\n\nHow did you get into that kind of world yourself? I know you\u2019re living in the town of Kerikeri up north, but Kerikeri is probably the most white middle-class town in all of Northland, isn\u2019t it?\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, but you don\u2019t just stay in Kerikeri. You go around, you look at small towns. I love talking to people, finding out about other people, the Maori culture. I\u2019ve worked with Maori up here who come from the small towns to work in Kerikeri, and they are the loveliest people. They will tell me stories and tell me about the person down the road.\n\nIf you want to hear it, it\u2019s there. You can absorb what\u2019s going on around the country if you\u2019re interested. Everybody knows there\u2019s poverty up north, but you need to know why it\u2019s there and the people it effects. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in too.\n\nJenny Wheeler: This is intended as the first book in a series. There are certain things left open regarding significant relationships in Nyree\u2019s life. We won\u2019t do a spoiler by spelling that out too clearly, but I wondered if you\u2019re already working on book two. Do you have a big story arc that you\u2019re already working to?\n\nCatherine Lea: A big story arc that will go along the series. It\u2019s very much involved with that relationship you spoke about. That is certainly brought to the fore in the next book.\n\n## The intricacies of organising a series\n\nJenny Wheeler: When are you expecting that to be out?\n\nCatherine Lea: I don\u2019t know. I lay in bed last night. I\u2019ve put the book in a setting and I woke up \u2013 I\u2019m about quarter of the way through \u2013 and I thought, no, it\u2019s not right. I\u2019ve got to rip out the setting. I\u2019ve got to set it somewhere else. I\u2019ve got to take out some of the characters, put in some other characters, change a few. That\u2019s probably about half of what I\u2019ve written gone.\n\nBut it\u2019s not going to be right. I know it\u2019s not going to be right, because it\u2019s ended up feeling a little bit like Auckland or even Kerikeri, and I don\u2019t want that. I want it to be small town, so it\u2019s going to have some doctoring. That\u2019s what happens.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Even in this first book, there are a lot of characters because when you\u2019re investigating a crime like this, there are people who appear as potential suspects or witnesses and then they fade out again. The police have to deal with a lot of people who may not have a major role. Do you have a kind of Bible where you keep all those characters and all their names?\n\nCatherine Lea: No, I don\u2019t. I\u2019m absolutely hopeless. I need to do that because I end up thinking, oh my goodness, what was that character\u2019s name? I\u2019ll go back into the manuscript and have a look. So I need to do that. I\u2019m a terribly lazy writer.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Also, I feel myself that we are drawn to certain names without even knowing why. There are certain names that resonate with us. I find that for these very secondary characters, you think, I\u2019ll call him Bill. Then you think, hang on a minute, didn\u2019t I have a Bill so-and-so? Is that going to be confusing for the reader? Some of these people who don\u2019t have very big parts still can get confusing if you choose similar names.\n\n## Named after a well-known actress\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s exactly right.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I wondered with Nyree if that was a little play on our very well-known Ngaire.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it is.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Tell us about that.\n\nCatherine Lea: Ngaire Dawn Porter. Fabulous and I think largely forgotten in New Zealand. I thought, I want some background for my Nyree. What if her mother was a huge fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter? That\u2019s the reason I\u2019ve done that. I love the name.\n\nNyree is European, she\u2019s Pakeha but she\u2019s working in this area with Maori detectives and Maori suspects and Pakeha as well. I really wanted that mix going on.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Because 60% of our audience is overseas, expand a little bit on who Ngaire Dawn Porter was.\n\nCatherine Lea: She was an actress quite a few years ago. Her name was Ngaire which is a Maori name. I was originally going to call her Ngaire with that spelling. I asked one of my American readers \u2013 and this is exactly what happened to Ngaire Dawn Porter \u2013 what do you think of the beginning of the book? She said, it\u2019s great, I really like it. I said, how do you pronounce her name? She said, it\u2019s Nigier. I thought, no, that\u2019s not going to work, so I\u2019m going to have her a Pakeha whose mother was a fan of Ngaire Dawn Porter and she is going to have that same name.\n\nJenny Wheeler: There also is another funny link, and that\u2019s with Ngaio Marsh. I wondered whether there was that as well. Ngaio Marsh was a really well-known New Zealand writer.\n\n## And honoring Dame Ngaio Marsh\n\nCatherine Lea: Internationally known, yes.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We have mentioned your international thrillers. I read The Candidate\u2019s Daughter and I loved it. I love American political stories anyway, so I was probably a good candidate. It\u2019s called the Elizabeth McClaine series and there are three books in that series as well.\n\nIn this story, Elizabeth McClaine is the wife of a Senate candidate whose child is kidnapped just as they\u2019re coming up to an election. She turns into an amateur investigator because she gets frustrated about what she sees as the lack of progress in finding her daughter.\n\nYou seem to have quite a soft spot for children. Children appear in a number of your books. In The Water\u2019s Dead there is a child involved as well. That seems to be quite deliberate because it is in a lot of your books. What does it bring to the story, do you feel?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Candidate\u2019s Daughter was my first thriller out, and I had a disabled daughter who passed away in 2014. I cared for her, and that\u2019s a long story. I\u2019ve actually written a memoir which I will edit at some stage. I wanted to bring to the fore the mixed feelings of a parent with a disabled child. When I had my daughter in 1981, I can remember people crossing the street so that they wouldn\u2019t have to talk to me. There was a huge stigma at that time.\n\n## Elizabeth Mclaine\u2019s daughterPersonal\n\nHaving a child with disabilities is still tough, so I wanted to have my child who is kidnapped as a child with disabilities so that you could see the struggle of the mother. I hadn\u2019t deliberately put the kidnapper in there, but she kind of popped up. I write as it comes. I don\u2019t plot. When Kelsey turned up and she had this amazing relationship with the child, I kept running with it. I thought, this is what Elizabeth, the main character wants, but can\u2019t seem to achieve until she realizes the value of her daughter all the way through.\n\nI guess that\u2019s a little bit of a journey I went through. It was so tough in the early days. When my daughter eventually came home to live \u2013 because she\u2019s been in shared care for a while, while I worked and tried to make something of myself \u2013 I realized what I\u2019d been missing by not having her at home. It\u2019s that story I wanted to put through.\n\nThe child in the second book, Child of the State, is also disabled. I wanted a theme of disability going through. When I started this series, I don\u2019t know why, but I had the young woman in the pool. Then I thought, what if she was looking after a child when she was murdered. That\u2019s where that came from. I didn\u2019t think, what\u2019s going to make this really good? That just popped in.\n\nJenny Wheeler: In The Candidate\u2019s Daughter I\u2019m not at all surprised you did have that backstory, although I didn\u2019t know anything about it, because the feeling of understanding with that mother is so strong in it. She\u2019s got a real sense of guilt and failure about the fact that she didn\u2019t manage to produce a beautiful child. They\u2019re quite upper-class and they\u2019ve got absolutely everything else in the world, and she feels as if she hasn\u2019t delivered on her part of the bargain as the candidate\u2019s wife.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Personal experience helped make it real\n\nThen, as you say, after her daughter goes missing she starts to understand how she didn\u2019t know very much about her daughter at all even though she lived in the same house because she paid somebody else to care for her. She actually held her at arm\u2019s length emotionally speaking because she couldn\u2019t face her own failure. That came through in a very touching way in the story.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you.\n\nJenny Wheeler: You also write under another pen name of C J Lea. I wondered how that happened because they look like they are fairly similar books.\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s about a serial killer. I love the book. I just don\u2019t know whether it resonated terribly well with readers. Some readers loved it. The main characters is Raymond. He is in a wheelchair and he\u2019s a psychopath. He makes his living \u2013 and it was quite feasible at the time \u2013 by entering competitions and selling off the proceeds. But he wasn\u2019t too proud, if somebody else had won the prize, something expensive, to go and kill them and sell their prize online.\n\nHe is ruthless, he is a psychopath. He discovers a $10 million treasure hunt and decides to go into it, and then he discovers he\u2019s not the only psychopathic killer in the competition. That was a lot of fun, but it\u2019s quite brutal, so I thought I\u2019d better distance my other writing from that. The Elizabeth McClaine books sold better. I loved the first one, but they sold better, and there\u2019s no point in carrying on a series if nobody\u2019s interested in it.\n\n## What drew Catherine Lea to writing fiction\n\nJenny Wheeler: Turning away from talking about specific books to a little bit about your wider career \u2013 what drew you into writing, and what did you do before you became this full-time writer that you are now?\n\nCatherine Lea: I worked in recruitment and I worked in the IT industry. I\u2019m not an IT person, but I worked in sales. For a short while I worked for Barry Colman when he had the internet. He had invested in some international satellite capacity, and I ended up working for him and selling the transponder space.\n\nIt was tiny. It was basically three of us in the company, and while I was there, he put us into the NBR offices of the National Business Review. I got to talk to journalists and people of words and writers and it was lovely being around them, and so I did a creative writing course. One of my dear friends, Deborah, who was an editor there, said, you\u2019ve got some talent. This is really good.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t. It was rubbish, but it was fairly well-written rubbish. I think that\u2019s how most writers start out. They have usually got a few books under their belt that will never see the light of day, but it gave me the feeling that I could do something and I could achieve something. I\u2019ve been doing it ever since.\n\n## Writing with a family and fulltime job\n\nJenny Wheeler: How long is that?\n\nCatherine Lea: That\u2019s the mid to late nineties. I\u2019ve been writing since then.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We like to talk about your taste in books as well, because this is The Joys of Binge Reading. We like to give readers recommendations for things they might like apart from your books, and we focus very much on the popular genre fiction end of the publishing world.\n\nWhat do you like to read? I imagine you have always been a big reader, but in the past or now, what are some of your favorites?\n\nCatherine Lea: The Dry by Jane Harper. I was overseas with my sister and I saw it in the airport bookstore. I started reading it and after a while, she\u2019d go, what are you doing? Are you still reading that book? I\u2019d have it down here. No, no. I love Jane Harper. Chris Hammer. I read his Scrublands. That was brilliant. I absolutely loved that.\n\nJenny Wheeler: We\u2019ve had Chris on the show.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, I know. He\u2019s so good \u2013 the two of them. What I really loved is how the place was actually a character in the book. And I loved Morse. I never forgave him when he killed Morse. I hope that\u2019s not a spoiler for anyone.\n\n## Favorite books \u2013 what Catherine is reading\n\nJenny Wheeler: It happened quite a while ago now.\n\nCatherine Lea: Yes, it did. Another of my favorites, funnily enough, was an author that my mother loved. It was Ed McBain. I loved him. Years ago, his 87th precinct was behind the Hill Street Blues series. That\u2019s what it was based on \u2013 Ed McBain\u2019s stories. That is one of the things I wanted in this book \u2013 not just having one main character, but I wanted the reader to slowly get to know the team. I will keep the same team together as much as possible so that they get to know the other characters as well \u2013 the other investigators and detectives.\n\nJenny Wheeler: A lot of them you\u2019ve knocked out already \u2013 without giving anything away. It was a great twist at the end.\n\nCatherine Lea: Thank you. It\u2019s the sense of community within the team as well. That\u2019s what I wanted to keep.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Looking back down the tunnel of time, if there was one thing about your creative career that you\u2019d change, what would it be?\n\nCatherine Lea: I\u2019d write faster. That\u2019s the only thing I\u2019d change. You really need to write to learn to write. I know a lot of people want to put out their first book and have a bestseller.\n\n## The 0ne thing Catherine would change\n\nSome people do, and that\u2019s fantastic. But honestly, after writing so many books, you know where the beats are and the pinch points and where the arc is going and where the crescendo is, and when you\u2019ve got to tie up all those loose ends. That\u2019s the fun of writing the book, taking the reader along on that journey. But it takes a lot of time to learn to do that. Or maybe I\u2019m just a slow learner.\n\nJenny Wheeler: I think it the old Malcolm Gladwell thing of 10,000 hours, however you put them in.\n\nCatherine Lea: Unless you\u2019re Ben Saunders.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Yes. What is next for Catherine as author? When you look over the next 12 months, what do you have coming up in terms of your writing?\n\nCatherine Lea: The second book in this series. It\u2019s important that I get this right. The first one was a mission to write, but the time I took bedded down the type of book I want to write. I\u2019m hoping to get this next one out within the year. Boy, I really am hoping to get it out and carry on the series.\n\nI\u2019ve also got others that I put on the back burner. One is a girls series of mysteries, but it\u2019s girls from the age of 9 to 99. I call them The Mysteries of Mosey Blaine, and I\u2019ve started a rewrite on it.\n\n## Never Miss out!\n\n## Where Catherine can be found online\n\nIt\u2019s a comedy, it\u2019s humorous, and it\u2019s about two girls who are complete nerds solving mysteries at their school where nobody knows them. It\u2019s incorporating all those typical characters you get at school \u2013 the gossips, the meanies, the ducks. I would like to bring that out because it\u2019s a fun ride. But I have got to not take on too much.\n\nJenny Wheeler: Do you enjoy interacting with your readers and where can they find you online?\n\nJenny Wheeler: We will have all those links in the show notes for the episode, so people will be able to find them online. Catherine, it has been wonderful talking. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n## If you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy\u2026\n\nIf you enjoyed Catherine you might also enjoy New Zealand crime writer Nikki Crutchley\u2019s small town crime series. https://thejoysofbingereading.com/nikki-crutchley-country-crime-thrillers/:\n\nNext week on Binge Reading, we have Regency romance queen Stephanie Laurens.
