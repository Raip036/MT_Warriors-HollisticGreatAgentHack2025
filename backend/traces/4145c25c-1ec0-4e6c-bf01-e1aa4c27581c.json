Following proper dosing if using over-the-counter pain relievers\n2. Consulting a healthcare provider if:\n- Your headache is severe or unusual for you\n- Over-the-counter medications don't help\n- Your headaches are becoming more frequent\n- You have other concerning symptoms\n\nWould you like to know more specific information about headache treatments?

To give you a more complete answer, I would need additional evidence about:\n- Different types of headaches and their treatments\n- Recommended dosing for headache medications\n- Non-medication options for headache relief\n- Warning signs that require medical attention\n\nFor now, I can only confirm that these common pain medications may help, but they must be taken according to package directions or NHS guidelines.\n\nSince headaches can have many causes and some may require medical attention, I recommend:\n1. Following proper dosing if using over-the-counter pain relievers\n2. Consulting a healthcare provider if:\n- Your headache is severe or unusual for you\n- Over-the-counter medications don't help\n- Your headaches are becoming more frequent\n- You have other concerning symptoms\n\nWould you like to know more specific information about headache treatments?
