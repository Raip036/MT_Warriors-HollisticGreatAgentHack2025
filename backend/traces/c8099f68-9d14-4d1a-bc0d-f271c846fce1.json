            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

Should i do something? Will i be ok and how can i avoid damage to my body?Thanks for reading\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are still within the maximum daily dose. You'll be okay.\nJust don't take anymore. I'd even avoid taking any over the next 24 hours .What were you taking it for? I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

          "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note.

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

          "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen\n\n[3] Took 2000mg of Paracetamol by Mistake - What Now?\nURL: https://www.justanswer.com/medical/qmk22-took-2000mg-paracetamol-once-mistake-shoukd-go.html?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\nMedical\n\n# I took 2000mg of paracetamol at once by mistake.

If you have any additional information for me in the meantime, please let me know.\n\nI am so sorry and I greatly value your patience, let me help you.\n\nTaking 2000 mg of paracetamol at once is double the recommended single dose but is usually below the toxic level for most healthy adults. While serious harm is unlikely, monitor for symptoms like nausea, vomiting, upper-right abdominal pain, or confusion, which could indicate liver stress. Drink plenty of water, avoid any more paracetamol for the next 24 hours, and rest. If you have liver disease, are underweight, or take medications that interact with paracetamol, it\u2019s best to contact your doctor in person.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n\nMy thoughts are with you. :)\n\nTake care and have a great day.\n\nYes you may do it.\n\n## Accidental High-Dose Paracetamol Intake: When to Seek Help\n\n## Related Customer Questions\n\n### Getting Started Is Easy\n\n#### What Our Users Say\n\n- 1\n\n- 2\n\n- 3\n\n- 4\n\n##### Why Millions Trust JustAnswer\n\n###### Highly rated, verified Experts\n\n[4] Paracetamol poisoning - Wikipedia\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol_poisoning?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\nParacetamol poisoning\n\n- [Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol_poisoning) - [Talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Paracetamol_poisoning)\n\nFor the tampering of Tylenol bottles in 1982, see [Chicago Tylenol murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Tylenol_murders).\n\n**Paracetamol poisoning**, also known as **acetaminophen poisoning**, is caused by excessive use of the medication [paracetamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol) (acetaminophen).[2] Most people have few or [non-specific symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-specific_symptoms) in the first 24 hours following overdose.

If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together.\n\n[5] What happens when children overdose on paracetamol? | Vinmec\nURL: https://www.vinmec.com/eng/blog/what-happens-in-an-overdose-of-paracetamol-in-children-en?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\n# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing.

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose.

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.\n\n[10] Paracetamol overdose A&E leaflet - University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust\nURL: https://www.uhsussex.nhs.uk/resources/paracetamol-overdose-emergency-department-leaflet/?utm_source=valyu.ai&utm_medium=referral\nHome > Resources > Paracetamol overdose A&E leaflet\n\n# Paracetamol overdose A&E leaflet\n\nInformation for if you have gone to the Emergency Department following a paracetamol overdose.\n\nHome > Resources > Paracetamol overdose A&E leaflet\n\n# Paracetamol overdose A&E leaflet\n\nInformation for if you have gone to the Emergency Department following a paracetamol overdose.\n\nWe use some essential cookies to make this website work.

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking.

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

            "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note.

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

              "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

While serious harm is unlikely, monitor for symptoms like nausea, vomiting, upper-right abdominal pain, or confusion, which could indicate liver stress.

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                  "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                  "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight.

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

              "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

              "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

I know the recommended dosage is 1000g at a time but now I've accidently taken 1500mgI'm scared something is going to happen to me, i feel fine but I'm worried it'll damage my liver or kidneys. Should i do something? Will i be ok and how can i avoid damage to my body?Thanks for reading\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are still within the maximum daily dose. You'll be okay.\nJust don't take anymore. I'd even avoid taking any over the next 24 hours .What were you taking it for? I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

              "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

              "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

              "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

              "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing.

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time.

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking.

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

I know the recommended dosage is 1000g at a time but now I've accidently taken 1500mgI'm scared something is going to happen to me, i feel fine but I'm worried it'll damage my liver or kidneys. Should i do something? Will i be ok and how can i avoid damage to my body?Thanks for reading\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are still within the maximum daily dose. You'll be okay.\nJust don't take anymore. I'd even avoid taking any over the next 24 hours .What were you taking it for? I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

If you have any additional information for me in the meantime, please let me know.\n\nI am so sorry and I greatly value your patience, let me help you.\n\nTaking 2000 mg of paracetamol at once is double the recommended single dose but is usually below the toxic level for most healthy adults. While serious harm is unlikely, monitor for symptoms like nausea, vomiting, upper-right abdominal pain, or confusion, which could indicate liver stress. Drink plenty of water, avoid any more paracetamol for the next 24 hours, and rest. If you have liver disease, are underweight, or take medications that interact with paracetamol, it\u2019s best to contact your doctor in person.\n\nIs there anything else I can help you with?\n\nMy thoughts are with you. :)\n\nTake care and have a great day.\n\nYes you may do it.\n\n## Accidental High-Dose Paracetamol Intake: When to Seek Help\n\n## Related Customer Questions\n\n### Getting Started Is Easy\n\n#### What Our Users Say\n\n- 1\n\n- 2\n\n- 3\n\n- 4\n\n##### Why Millions Trust JustAnswer\n\n###### Highly rated, verified Experts"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

              "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

              "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

I know the recommended dosage is 1000g at a time but now I've accidently taken 1500mgI'm scared something is going to happen to me, i feel fine but I'm worried it'll damage my liver or kidneys. Should i do something? Will i be ok and how can i avoid damage to my body?Thanks for reading\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are still within the maximum daily dose. You'll be okay.\nJust don't take anymore. I'd even avoid taking any over the next 24 hours .What were you taking it for? I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

              "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

              "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

          "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

              "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

              "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing.

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

            "canonical_answer": "Based on the evidence, I can provide a clear answer about your situation:\n\nTaking one extra paracetamol tablet by accident is unlikely to cause serious harm, but here's what you should know:\n\nThe safe daily maximum for adults is 4 grams (8 x 500mg tablets) in 24 hours. For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

I know the recommended dosage is 1000g at a time but now I've accidently taken 1500mgI'm scared something is going to happen to me, i feel fine but I'm worried it'll damage my liver or kidneys. Should i do something? Will i be ok and how can i avoid damage to my body?Thanks for reading\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are still within the maximum daily dose. You'll be okay.\nJust don't take anymore. I'd even avoid taking any over the next 24 hours .What were you taking it for? I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking.

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

For your age (14), the dose should be lower and based on your weight - typically 10-15mg per kg per dose, up to 60mg/kg total per day according to the evidence.\n\nWhat to do now:\n1. Don't take any more paracetamol for at least 24 hours\n2. Drink plenty of water\n3. Monitor how you feel \n\nWatch for any concerning symptoms like:\n- Nausea or vomiting \n- Abdominal pain (especially on the right side)\n- Unusual tiredness\n- Any yellowing of eyes/skin\n\nWhile one extra tablet is unlikely to be dangerous, it's important to:\n- Always read medication labels carefully\n- Keep track of doses and timing\n- Use proper measuring tools\n- Never \"top up\" doses if pain persists\n\nFor your safety: If you develop any concerning symptoms, or if you're unsure about exactly how much you took, you should tell a parent/guardian and contact a healthcare provider right away. They can properly assess the situation and provide appropriate care if needed.\n\nRemember for next time: The evidence shows that even slightly exceeding the recommended dose regularly can potentially cause harm over time. Always stick to the recommended dose for your age/weight.\n\nWould you like me to explain anything else about paracetamol safety or proper dosing?",

Should i do something? Will i be ok and how can i avoid damage to my body?Thanks for reading\n\n**Answer:**\nYou are still within the maximum daily dose. You'll be okay.\nJust don't take anymore. I'd even avoid taking any over the next 24 hours .What were you taking it for? I know someone who did end up damaging kidneys because she was taking paracetamol chronically, if you've gotta take it often it is best to talk with a doctor and see what other options there are for pain or whatever .\n\n*Upvotes: 10*"

Paracetamol is safe for most people to take and side effects are rare.\n\nYou can buy most types of paracetamol from supermarkets or pharmacies. Some types are only available on prescription.\n\n## What is paracetamol used for?\n\nParacetamol can be used to treat pain, including:\n\n- headaches\n\n- toothache\n\n- sprains\n\nIt can also reduce fevers caused by illnesses like colds and flu.\n\n## Types of paracetamol\n\nParacetamol is available as:\n\n- tablets or caplets\n\n- capsules\n\n- liquid \u2013 usually for children\n\n- soluble tablets (tablets that dissolve in water to make a drink)\n\n- suppositories (capsules inserted into the back passage)\n\n- an injection given into a vein \u2013 normally only used in hospital\n\nIn some products, paracetamol is combined with other ingredients. This includes cold and flu remedies or certain combination painkillers.\n\nIt may be sold under the name paracetamol or under a brand name (which may also contain other ingredients).\n\n## How to take paracetamol\n\nHow much paracetamol you can take depends on:\n\n- your age\n\n- your weight\n\n- the type of paracetamol you\u2019re taking\n\n- how strong the paracetamol is\n\n### Adults\n\nAdults can usually take 1 or 2 tablets (500mg) every 4 to 6 hours. They shouldn\u2019t take more than 4g (8x 500mg tablets) in the space of 24 hours. Always read the instructions that come with your medicine because dosage and strength of the tablet can vary.\n\nParacetamol should start to work within an hour. The effect usually lasts several hours. Don\u2019t take more than the recommended dose if it isn\u2019t relieving your symptoms.\n\nAdults can take ibuprofen with paracetamol if necessary.\n\n### Children\n\nChildren under 16 need to take a lower dose of paracetamol depending on their age or weight. Check the packet or leaflet, or ask a pharmacist or doctor for advice.\n\nParacetamol is usually given to very young children using a measuring spoon or an oral syringe.\n\n## Possible side effects\n\nSide effects from paracetamol are rare but can include:\n\n- an allergic reaction \u2013 this can cause a rash and swelling\n\n- flushing\n\n- low blood pressure\n\n- a fast heartbeat\n\n- blood disorders\n\n- liver and kidney damage, if you take too much (overdose) \u2013 this can be fatal in severe cases\n\nSpeak to a pharmacist or doctor if you develop any worrying side effects that you think could be caused by paracetamol.\n\n### Speak to your GP or phone 111 if:\n\nYour symptoms:\n\n- get worse\n\n- last more than 3 days despite taking paracetamol\n\n## Reporting side effects\n\nThe Yellow Card Scheme also allows you to report side effects from any type of medicine you\u2019re taking. It\u2019s run by a medicines safety watchdog called the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).\n\nFurther information on the Yellow Card Scheme\n\n## Warnings and precautions\n\nMost people can take paracetamol safely, including:\n\n- pregnant women\n\n- breastfeeding women\n\n- children over 2 months of age \u2013 lower doses are recommended for young children\n\nRead the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine. You should discuss any concerns or queries with your pharmacist or GP.\n\nAlways get advice before taking paracetamol if you:\n\n- have liver or kidney problems\n\n- have problems with alcohol, like long-term alcohol misuse\n\n- are very underweight\n\n- are taking other medications\n\nDon\u2019t take paracetamol if you\u2019ve had an allergic reaction to it in the past.\n\n### Other medicines and paracetamol\n\nIt may not be safe to take paracetamol at the same time as:\n\n- other products containing paracetamol\n\n- carbamazepine \u2013 used to treat epilepsy and some types of pain\n\n- colestyramine \u2013 used to reduce itchiness caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (a type of liver disease)\n\n- imatinib and busulfan \u2013 used to treat certain types of cancer\n\n- ketoconazole \u2013 a type of antifungal medicine\n\n- lixisenatide \u2013 used to treat type 2 diabetes\n\n- metoclopramide \u2013 used to relieve nausea and vomiting\n\n- phenobarbital, phenytoin and primidone \u2013 used to control seizures\n\n- warfarin \u2013 used to prevent blood clots\n\nCheck the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if it can be taken with paracetamol. Ask a pharmacist or doctor if you\u2019re not sure.\n\n## Paracetamol overdose\n\nTaking too much paracetamol can be very dangerous. This is known as an overdose.\n\nAfter taking too much paracetamol, some people:\n\n- feel sick\n\n- vomit\n\n- have abdominal (tummy) pain\n\nOften there are no obvious symptoms at first.\n\nYou should speak to a pharmacist or GP practice if you have taken more than the recommended dose of paracetamol and are feeling unwell. Phone 111 if your GP practice or pharmacy are closed.\n\nSource: NHS 24 - Opens in new browser window\n\nLast updated: 13 August 2024\n\n## Help us improve NHS inform\n\n## Thank You\n\nYour feedback has been received\n\n### Also on NHS inform\n\n- Ibuprofen"

These symptoms include feeling tired, [abdominal pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdominal_pain), or [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea). This is typically followed by absence of symptoms for a couple of days, after which [yellowish skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice), [blood clotting problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulopathy), and [confusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy) occurs as a result of [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure). Additional complications may include [kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kidney_failure), [pancreatitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pancreatitis), [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), and [lactic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acidosis). If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks.[3][4] Without treatment, death from toxicity occurs 4 to 18 days later.[5]\n\n| Paracetamol poisoning |\n| --- |\n| Other names | Acetaminophen toxicity, paracetamol toxicity, acetaminophen poisoning, paracetamol overdose, acetaminophen overdose, Tylenol toxicity |\n| --- | --- |\n| |\n| Paracetamol |\n| Specialty | Toxicology |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symptoms | Early: Non specific, feeling tired, abdominal pain, nauseaLater: Yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, confusion |\n| --- | --- |\n| Complications | Liver failure, kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, lactic acidosis. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Usual onset | After 24 hours (toxicity)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Causes | Paracetamol (acetaminophen) usually > 7 g[2][1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Risk factors | Alcoholism, malnutrition, certain other hepatotoxic medications[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Diagnostic method | Blood levels at specific times following use[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Differential diagnosis | Alcoholism, viral hepatitis, gastroenteritis[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Treatment | Activated charcoal, acetylcysteine, liver transplant[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prognosis | Death occurs in ~0.1%[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n| Frequency | >100,000 per year (US)[1] |\n| --- | --- |\n\nParacetamol poisoning can occur accidentally or as a [suicide attempt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_method). Risk factors for toxicity include [alcoholism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism), [malnutrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition), and the taking of certain other [hepatotoxic medications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity).[1] [Liver damage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatotoxicity) results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its [metabolites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolite), [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[6] NAPQI decreases the liver's [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) and directly damages cells in the liver.[7] Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken.[1] These values are often plotted on the [Rumack-Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack-Matthew_nomogram) to determine level of concern.[1]\n\nTreatment may include [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal_(medication)) if the person seeks medical help soon after the overdose.[1] Attempting to force the person to [vomit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomit) is not recommended.[6] If there is a potential for toxicity, the antidote [acetylcysteine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcysteine) is recommended.[1] The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours.[6] [Psychiatric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatric) care may be required following recovery.[1] A [liver transplant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_transplant) may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on [low blood pH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acidosis), high [blood lactate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_lactate), poor blood clotting, or significant [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy). With early treatment, liver failure is rare.[6] Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.[1]\n\nParacetamol poisoning was first described in the 1960s.[6] Rates of poisoning vary significantly between regions of the world.[8] In the United States more than 100,000 cases occur a year.[1] In the United Kingdom it is the medication responsible for the greatest number of overdoses.[7] Young children are most commonly affected.[1] In the United States and the United Kingdom, paracetamol is the most common cause of [acute liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_liver_failure).[9][1]\n\n## Contents\n\n- [1 Signs and symptoms](#Signs_and_symptoms) - [2 Cause](#Cause) 2.1 Risk factors - [3 Pathophysiology](#Pathophysiology) - [4 Diagnosis](#Diagnosis) 4.1 Detection in body fluids - [5 Prevention](#Prevention) 5.1 Limitation of availability 5.2 Combination with other agents 5.3 Paracetamol replacements - [6 Treatment](#Treatment) 6.1 Gastrointestinal decontamination 6.2 Acetylcysteine 6.3 Liver transplant - [7 Prognosis](#Prognosis) - [8 Epidemiology](#Epidemiology) - [9 References](#References) - [10 External links](#External_links)\n\n## Signs and symptoms\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=1)\n\nWidespread necrosis in the central venule regions of the liver acinus. Lipid droplets have merged to form lipid lakes. Mostly viable hepatocytes in the portal area (zone 1) of the liver acinus, with arrows pointing to a necrotic zone on the edgeThese H&E pathology slides were taken from an acetaminophen poisoning case involving an adult with a history of alcohol abuse. Case contributed by Dr. Linda Ferrell, UCSF, Department of Pathology.\n\nThe signs and symptoms of paracetamol toxicity occur in three phases. The first phase begins within hours of overdose, and consists of [nausea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausea), vomiting, a [pale appearance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallor), and [sweating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweating).[10] However, patients often have no specific symptoms or only mild symptoms in the first 24 hours of poisoning. Rarely, after massive overdoses, patients may develop symptoms of [metabolic acidosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_acidosis) and coma early in the course of poisoning.[11][12]\n\nThe second phase occurs between 24 hours and 72 hours following overdose and consists of signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in [liver cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) as they metabolize the paracetamol. Hallmark pathology on liver biopsy includes regions of [coagulative necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulative_necrosis) in zone 3 of the [liver acinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_acinus), around the [central venules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_veins_of_the_liver), as these hepatocytes have higher concentrations of [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450) enzymes compared to zone 1 hepatocytes surrounding the portal venule of the acinus. Remaining viable hepatocytes frequently show [ballooning injury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballooning_degeneration) and [steatosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatosis).[13] The individual may experience [right upper quadrant abdominal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_upper_quadrant_(abdomen)) pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; [International normalized ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_normalized_ratio) (INR) and the liver [transaminases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaminase) [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) and [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase) rise to abnormal levels.[14] [Acute kidney failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_kidney_failure) may also occur during this phase, typically caused by either [hepatorenal syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatorenal_syndrome) or [multiple organ dysfunction syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_organ_dysfunction_syndrome). In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity. In these cases, it has been suggested that the toxic metabolite is produced more in the kidneys than in the liver.[15]\n\nThe third phase follows at 3 to 5 days, and is marked by complications of massive liver [necrosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necrosis) leading to [fulminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fulminant) liver failure with complications of [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation) defects, [low blood sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia), kidney failure, [hepatic encephalopathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatic_encephalopathy), [brain swelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_edema), [sepsis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepsis), multiple organ failure, and death.[10] If the third phase is survived, the liver necrosis runs its course, and liver and [kidney function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renal_physiology) typically return to normal in a few weeks.[16] The severity of paracetamol toxicity varies depending on the dose and whether appropriate treatment is received.\n\n## Cause\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=2)\n\nThe toxic dose of paracetamol is highly variable. In general the recommended maximum daily dose for healthy adults is 4 grams.[17][18] Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10 grams or 200 mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, have a reasonable likelihood of causing toxicity.[19][20] Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24 hours exceed these levels.[20] Following a dose of 1 gram of paracetamol four times a day for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in [alanine transaminase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase) in their [liver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_function_tests) to [typically](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median) about three times the normal value.[21] It is unlikely that this dose would lead to [liver failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liver_failure).[22] Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days.[23] In adults, a dose of 6 grams a day over the preceding 48 hours could potentially lead to toxicity,[20] while in children acute doses above 200 mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity.[24] Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.[20]\n\nIntentional overdosing (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) is frequently implicated in paracetamol toxicity.[25] In a 2006 review, paracetamol was the most frequently ingested compound in intentional overdosing.[26]\n\nIn rare individuals, paracetamol toxicity can result from normal use.[27] This may be due to individual (\"[idiosyncratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiosyncratic)\") differences in the expression and activity of certain enzymes in one of the [metabolic pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_pathway) that handle paracetamol (see [paracetamol's metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol#Metabolism)).\n\n### Risk factors\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=3)\n\nA number of factors can potentially increase the risk of developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption_and_health) can [induce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme_induction_and_inhibition) [CYP2E1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP2E1), thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less.[28] Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered a risk factor has been debated by some clinical toxicologists.[29][30] For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect.[29][31] For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.\n\n[Fasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting) is a risk factor, possibly because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.[20] The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inducer [isoniazid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoniazid) increases the risk of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction is related to the hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear.[32][33] Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including [carbamazepine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbamazepine), [phenytoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenytoin), and [barbiturates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbiturate), have also been reported as risk factors.[34]\n\n## Pathophysiology\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=4)\n\nMain pathways of paracetamol metabolism (click to enlarge). The pathway leading to NAPQI is shown in red.\n\nWhen taken in normal therapeutic doses, paracetamol has been shown to be safe.[14] Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via [Phase II metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_metabolism#Phase_I_vs._Phase_II) by conjugation with [sulfate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfate) and [glucuronide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glucuronide), with a small portion being oxidized via the [cytochrome P450](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cytochrome_P450_oxidase) enzyme system.[35] Cytochromes P450 2E1 and [3A4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4) convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPQI) (NAPQI).[35][14][36][37][38] Under normal conditions, NAPQI is detoxified by conjugation with [glutathione](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutathione) to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.[35][39]\n\nIn cases of paracetamol overdose, the sulfate and glucuronide pathways become saturated, and more paracetamol is shunted to the cytochrome P450 system to produce NAPQI. As a result, hepatocellular supplies of glutathione become depleted, as the demand for glutathione is higher than its regeneration.[39] NAPQI therefore remains in its toxic form in the liver and reacts with [cellular membrane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane) molecules, resulting in widespread [hepatocyte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepatocyte) damage and death, leading to acute liver necrosis.[35][40] In animal studies, the liver's stores of glutathione must be depleted to less than 70% of normal levels before liver toxicity occurs.[36]\n\n## Diagnosis\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=5)\n\nRumack\u2013Matthew nomogram with treatment line added at 150\n\nA person's history of taking paracetamol is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis.[41] The most effective way to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug [nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nomogram) developed in 1975, called the [Rumack\u2013Matthew nomogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumack%E2%80%93Matthew_nomogram), estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given number of hours after ingestion.[10] To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury.[20] A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be in the process of being absorbed from the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract). Therefore, a serum level taken before 4 hours is not recommended.[19]\n\nClinical or biochemical evidence of liver toxicity may develop in one to four days, although, in severe cases, it may be evident in 12 hours.[42] Right-upper-quadrant tenderness may be present and can aid in diagnosis. Laboratory studies may show evidence of liver necrosis with elevated [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartate_transaminase), [ALT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alanine_transaminase), [bilirubin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilirubin), and prolonged coagulation times, particularly an elevated [prothrombin time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin_time).[43] After paracetamol overdose, when AST and ALT exceed 1000 IU/L, paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity can be diagnosed.[42] In some cases, the AST and ALT levels can exceed 10,000 IU/L.[44]\n\n### Detection in body fluids\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=6)\n\nParacetamol may be quantified in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30 mg/L, which equals 200 \u03bcmol/L.[45] Levels of 30\u2013300 mg/L (200\u20132000 \u03bcmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50 to 400 mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated [colorimetric techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorimetric_analysis), [gas chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_chromatography) and [liquid chromatography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatography#Liquid_chromatography) are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.[46][47]\n\n## Prevention\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=7)\n\nAwareness poster on acetaminophen abuse\n\n### Limitation of availability\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=8)\n\nLimiting the availability of paracetamol tablets has been attempted in some countries. In the UK, sales of over-the-counter paracetamol are restricted to packs of 32 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in pharmacies, and 16 \u00d7 500 mg tablets in non-pharmacy outlets. Pharmacists may provide up to 100 tablets for those with chronic conditions at the pharmacist's discretion.[48][49] In Ireland, the limits are 24 and 12 tablets, respectively.[50] Subsequent study suggests that the reduced availability in large numbers had a significant effect in reducing poisoning deaths from paracetamol overdose.[51]\n\nOne suggested method of prevention is to make paracetamol a prescription-only medicine, or to remove it entirely from the market. However, overdose is a relatively minor problem; for example, 0.08% of the UK population (over 50 thousand people) present with paracetamol overdose each year. In contrast, paracetamol is a safe and effective medication that is taken without complications by millions of people.[52] In addition, alternative [pain relief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_management) medications such as [aspirin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspirin) are more toxic in overdose, whereas [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drugs) are associated with more adverse effects following normal use.[53]\n\n### Combination with other agents\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=9)\n\nOne strategy for reducing harm done by acetaminophen overdoses is selling paracetamol pre-combined in tablets either with an [emetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emetic)[52] or an antidote. Paradote was a tablet sold in the UK which combined 500 mg paracetamol with 100 mg [methionine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methionine),[54] an amino acid formerly[20] used in the treatment of paracetamol overdose.\n\nThere have been no studies so far on the effectiveness of paracetamol when given in combination with its most commonly used antidote, acetylcysteine.[55]\n\n[Calcitriol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcitriol), the active metabolite of [vitamin D3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholecalciferol), appears to be a catalyst for glutathione production.[56] Calcitriol was found to increase glutathione levels in rat astrocyte primary cultures on average by 42%, increasing glutathione protein concentrations from 29 nmol/mg to 41 nmol/mg, 24 and 48 hours after administration; it continued to have an influence on glutathione levels 96 hours after administration.[57] It has been proposed that co-administration of calcitriol, via injection, may improve treatment outcomes.\n\n### Paracetamol replacements\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=10)\n\nParacetamol ester [prodrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodrug) containing L-pyroglutamic acid (PGA), a biosynthetic precursor of glutathione, has been synthesized to reduce paracetamol hepatotoxicity and improve [bioavailability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioavailability). The toxicological studies of different paracetamol esters show that L-5-oxo-pyrrolidine-2-paracetamol carboxylate reduces toxicity after administration of an overdose of paracetamol to mice. The liver glutathione values in mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of the ester are superimposable with the GSH levels recorded in untreated mice control group. The mice group treated with an equivalent dose of paracetamol showed a significant decrease of glutathione of 35% (p<0.01 vs untreated control group). The oral [LD50](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_lethal_dose) was found to be greater than 2000 mg kg-1, whereas the intraperitoneal LD50 was 1900 mg kg-1. These results taken together with the good hydrolysis and bioavailability data show that this ester is a potential candidate as a prodrug of paracetamol.[58]\n\n## Treatment\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=11)\n\n### Gastrointestinal decontamination\n\n[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paracetamol_poisoning&action=edit&section=12)\n\nIn adults, the initial treatment for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete within two hours under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. [Gastric lavage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastric_lavage), better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion.[59] Administration of [activated charcoal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activated_charcoal) is the most common gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it efficiently [adsorbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsorption) paracetamol, thereby reducing its gastrointestinal absorption.[60][61] Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of [aspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspiration_pneumonia) than gastric lavage.[62]\n\nIt appears that the most benefit from activated charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion.[63][62] Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have [delayed gastric emptying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed_gastric_emptying) due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant decontamination.[42] There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine.[64] Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together."

                "content": "# What happens in an overdose of paracetamol in children?\n\nPh.D,\n\nPharmacist Phan Quynh Lan\n\nPharmacist, PhD Phan Quynh Lan, Director of Pharmacy at Vinmec Healthcare System and Head of Pharmacy Department at Vinmec Times City International General Hospital, conducted a professional consultation on the article. Pharmacist Lan has many years of experience in the field of Clinical Pharmacy, having served as a lecturer in the Department of Clinical Pharmacy at Hanoi University of Pharmacy.\n\nParacetamol is often used to treat pain and fever, and it is thought to be safe for everyone, even children. When giving the drug to young children, however, you need a prescription and advice from a doctor because an overdose of paracetamol can cause serious problems or even death.\n\n## 1. What is paracetamol?\n\nAcetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is an active ingredient that aids in pain relief and fever treatment, treating symptoms such as headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, backaches, toothaches, colds, and fevers. The drug only relieves pain in cases of mild inflammation but has no effect on severe inflammation, such as myositis.Paracetamol is used for adults, children, and pregnant women. However, pregnant women and children need a doctor's prescription to use paracetamol; they should not purchase the drug on their own to prevent side effects from an overdose.The drug is not recommended in cases of pain due to inflammation because the drug does not have an anti-inflammatory effect. Paracetamol use can lead to some of the following allergic reactions:\n\n- Allergy and skin rashes\n\n- Mouth pain, fever, and dyspnea\n\n- Nausea, weight loss, loss of appetite\n\n- Jaundice, yellow eyes.\n\nIf any symptoms occur when using paracetamol, stop taking it and see a doctor immediately.\n\n## 2. Recommended dose of paracetamol for children\n\nParacetamol for kids is usually made in powder sachets, syrups, and suppositories, each containing 80 mg, 150 mg, 250 mg, or 300 mg of the drug in them:\n\n- Powder sachets often have the aroma of fruits and have a sweet taste that is very suitable for children; they will not be afraid when using them. It is very convenient when children have a fever; just mix the medicine with water and give it to the child to drink.\n\n- The syrup form comes in a variety of flavors, making it easier for children to take medicine, and it has a similar fever-reducing effect to the powder sachet form.\n\n- Suppositories are used when children have a fever and cannot drink, vomit, or have convulsions, or when the child is sleeping and parents do not want to wake them up.\n\nThe usual dose of paracetamol is 10-15 mg/kg for one dose and a maximum of 60 mg/kg in one day. Take no more than 4\u20136 times a day, with a minimum interval of 4 hours between doses. When giving children paracetamol, it is necessary to follow the safe interval between two doses; otherwise, the child will overdose on paracetamol.\n\nIf the child's fever exceeds 38.5 degrees Celsius, as measured by an armpit thermometer, it is advisable to administer medication to lower the temperature. Children with liver disease or jaundice due to biliary obstruction should not use medication at home.When using paracetamol, if the child shows signs of fatigue, digestive disorders (such as diarrhea, vomiting), or lethargy, it is necessary to stop taking it immediately and take the child to the doctor for monitoring and treatment.\n\n## 3. What happens when children overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol overdose in children can lead to paracetamol poisoning. The reasons are:\n\n- When their children have a persistent fever that does not subside, many people give them paracetamol multiple times in a short period of time to reduce the fever.\n\n- Taking many medicines that contain paracetamol at the same time.\n\n- Using the medicine for a long time.\n\n- Administering a too high dosage\n\nSymptoms of paracetamol overdose in children:Case 1: (Within 24 hours after overdose)Children stop breastfeeding, lose appetite, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. After taking an overdose, the child gets feeble and goes into a coma.Case 2: (Within 24-72 hours after overdose)A child suffering from severe paracetamol poisoning will initially exhibit agitation and delirium. This is followed by central nervous system depression such as hypothermia, fatigue, rapid and shallow breathing; rapid, weak, irregular pulse; low blood pressure; and circulatory failure.\n\nCase 3: (Within 72-96 hours)Followed by a rapid increase in liver enzymes, the child is at risk of liver and kidney damage, respiratory failure, circulatory failure, and even death if not intervened promptly.\n\n## 4. Preventing paracetamol overdose in children\n\nDoctors advise parents to take their children to the hospital for an examination if they have had a fever for more than three days, if fever-reducing medications are ineffective, if they are allergic to the treatment, or if their temperature is 40\u201341 degrees Celsius. Parents should keep the medicine in a locked cabinet, out of children's sight and reach.Pregnant or breastfeeding women must consult a doctor or pharmacist when taking medication, because some drugs can enter breast milk and cause poisoning in breastfed infants.\n\nUse medication only as prescribed by a doctor; do not buy additional medication for children on your own. When using medication, read the ingredients carefully to avoid using multiple types with the same active ingredient. These ingredients are usually listed at the top of the medication label. Read the instructions carefully before use and use the correct dose according to the recommendations on the medication label and the instructions of the doctor/pharmacist.Use the provided dosing device, such as a dropper, cup, spoon, etc. Do not use other measuring tools, such as kitchen spoons, as they may provide the wrong dose of medication. Never drink liquid medication directly from a bottle or vial.\n\nCheck the medication three times before use. This practice is always necessary for any medication. First, check the outer packaging to see if it is intact. Second, check the label on the inner packaging to make sure you are taking the correct medication. Third, check the color, shape, size, and smell of the medication. If you notice anything unusual, stop taking the medication.Shake the bottle of liquid paracetamol before use. Chewable tablets should be chewed properly before swallowing. Your hands should be dry before handling disintegrating paracetamol tablets.When children have symptoms of paracetamol overdose or have worsening symptoms such as red skin or swelling in the painful area, rash, headache, nausea, or vomiting, call the emergency center 115 immediately or transfer the child to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible.\n\nAs a key area of the Vinmec Healthcare system, the Pediatrics Department always brings satisfaction to customers and is highly appreciated by experts in the industry with:\n\n- Gathering a team of pediatricians: including experts with high professional qualifications (professors, associate professors, doctors, masters), rich in experience, having worked at major hospitals such as Bach Mai, 108...

An overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nMost people would not think twice about popping a few paracetamol tablets to get rid of that throbbing headache.\n\nYet, a recent National University of Singapore (NUS) study has found that some people accidentally take too much of the common medicine, so much so that they end up in the emergency department of the hospital.\n\nHalf of the people who overdosed were young people aged 18 to 25, according to the study on patients admitted to the National University Hospital (NUH).\n\nMost of them were taking the medicine for pain relief, with headache (57.9 per cent) being the most common pain reported.\n\nOne should not take more than 4g \u2013 eight tablets \u2013 of paracetamol daily, based on recommended dosages.\n\nParacetamol is a \u201cgeneral sale list\u201d medication, meaning people can buy it without consulting a pharmacist or doctor. Medicine with paracetamol is widely available over the counter here,with 128 such products registered here, including those from the popular brand, Panadol.\n\nBesides those that help to relieve pain and reduce fever, many are also multi-ingredient medicines that treat cold and flu.\n\n\u201cA person might take a few of these products at the same time for symptom relief when he has a cold,\u201d said Dr Grant Sklar, a coauthor of the study, which was published last October in the Singapore Medical Journal online.\n\n\u201cThis can result in an accidental overdose of paracetamol if he doesn\u2019t read the label and list of ingredients,\u201d added Dr Sklar, whois a senior principal clinical pharmacist at NUH and associate professor at the pharmacy department of NUS.\n\nUNAWARE OF CORRECT DOSAGES\n\nFor the study, the researchers reviewed the medical records of 177 patients aged 18 to 75 who had been hospitalised at NUH after taking too much paracetamol between January 2011 and December 2013.\n\nParacetamol overdose occurred predominantly in young adults who deliberately consumed the medicine.\n\nNo one died.\n\nStill, 22.6 per cent of the cases were unintentional.\n\nThis suggests that healthcare providers can do more to educate the public on how to properly take the drug, said experts.\n\nReferring to the cases of accidental overdose, Dr Soong Jie Lin, a senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital, said: \u201cThe study suggested a lack of awareness of the usual recommended doses of paracetamol and potential toxicity from ingesting excessive amounts of paracetamol.\u201d\n\nIn the study, the median dose of paracetamol ingested was 10g. But not everyone downed the medication all at once.\n\nOne in 10 consumed too much of the medicine over more than two hours. Such \u201cstaggered ingestion\u201d can still give rise to the effects of overdosing.\n\nEight in 10 patients involved in the study suffered from nausea or vomiting, while more than half also experienced abdominal pain and dizziness.\n\nDespite this, among the people for whom information from a psychiatric review was available, nearly half (46.5 per cent) of those who consumed 10g of paracetamol or more did not think that their overdose was lethal.\n\nThis is not true. A paracetamol overdose can cause liver damage and even death.\n\nIn fact, paracetamol is the most common pharmaceutical agent involved in toxic exposure in Singapore.\n\nIt is also one of the most common causes of poisoning worldwide, being the leading cause of acute liver failure in the United States and United Kingdom.\n\nDr Soong, who was not involved in the study, said that another factor that may explain why young people accidentally overdose on the medication could be that they were exposed to it at a young age.\n\n\u201cParacetamol may be perceived as a relatively safe medication since it can be taken by infants and children as well,\u201d she said.\n\nANTIDOTE REDUCES LIVER DAMAGE\n\nIn the study, 76.3 per cent of the overdose cases were treated with an antidote, called N-acetylcysteine (NAC), to prevent the paracetamol from causing toxicity to the liver.\n\nPatients took a median time of 4.2 hours to show up at the hospital after taking too much paracetamol.\n\nThis is among those with a known estimated time of ingestion.\n\nMost cases came to NUH within seven hours of ingestion.\n\nThis allowed the doctors to start administering NAC in a timely manner.\n\nThe treatment is highly effective in preventing serious chemical damage to the liver when given within the first eight hours.\n\nAs for those who deliberately overdosed on paracetamol, most of them were women (75 per cent), according to the study.\n\n\u201cIn general, published local data suggests that women tend to use less violent means to attempt suicide, while men tend to use more violent or lethal means,\u201d said coauthor Dr Christina Tan, who was a doctoral student under Dr Sklar when she did the research.\n\nThe study also found that unintentional overdose was typically linked to a worse outcome for patients.\n\nDr Sklar said that those who suffered from an accidental overdose might seek treatment later, by which point more damage might have been done to the body.\n\nHe added: \u201cA person who takes an intentional overdose may have more symptoms, or regret what they did and tell someone. Such people are likely to get medical attention earlier.\u201d\n\nAVOID AN ACCIDENTAL OVERDOSE\n\n- Most people are probably more familiar with the brand name Panadol, rather than the active drug ingredient, paracetamol. Be aware, however, that paracetamol maybe marketed under different brands, as well as in multiple combination products for the treatment of cough and flu.\n\n- Given that paracetamol is usually indicated for mild to moderate pain, taking excessive doses will not help with more severe pain. Instead, it will increase the risk of side effects.\n\n- Be aware that paracetamol is sometimes known as acetaminophen, especially if you are seeing a doctor overseas.\n\n- Always read the drug ingredients listedon the medication boxes or packaging.\n\n- Be aware ofwhen paracetamol should be consumed, as well as the recommended doses.\n\n- Patients experiencing more severe pain may needa combination of several types of painkillers. They should consult a healthcare professional to evaluate the causes of the pain and get advice onthe appropriate choice and doses of painkillers.\n\nSource: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital.\n\nMAKE SURE YOU TAKE THE CORRECT DOSE OF PARACETOMOL\n\n4g - Dosage of paracetamol that should not be exceeded per day\n\nParacetamol is taken for pain relief and treatment of fever. It is commonly available as 500mg tablets.\n\nToday, 128 products with the ingredient line the shelves in Singapore.\n\nAdults are advised to take 1g doses, or two tablets, every four to six hours as necessary. One should not consume more than 4g, or eight tablets, per day.\n\nParacetamol is available in different strengths and formulations \u2013 this will affect the recommended dose and interval between doses.\n\nThe extended-release formulation of paracetamol, for instance, is sold in 665mg caplets. This product is designed to prolong the effect of the medicine, by gradually \u201creleasing\u201d the chemical for the body to absorb.\n\nIn this case, the dose recommended by the manufacturer is two caplets every eight hours, or upto six caplets a day.\n\nFor infants and children, the recommended dose of paracetamol is generally calculated based on their weight. Parents should consult their pharmacist or doctor to ensure that the correct dose is given to their child.\n\nConsumers should also read the labels and information on the appropriate use and dosage. They should get medical help if they have questions about paracetamol consumption, orwhen their condition does not improve or worsens after taking the medicine.\n\nSources: Dr Soong Jie Lin, senior clinical pharmacist at Singapore General Hospital; Health Sciences Authority.\n\nContributed by\n\n### Stay Healthy the Easy Way\n\nGet trusted health advice, offers and more.\n\n- About Us\n\n- FAQs\n\n- Contact Us\n\n- Events\n\n- Sitemap\n\nGet the Health Buddy App\n\nFollow HealthXchange\n\n- Terms and Conditions\n\n- PDPA\n\n- Disclaimer\n\n- Report Vulnerability"

Significant overdose can result in liver failure if not promptly treated with the antidote.\n\n### In this article:\n\n- What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\n- Why would someone take an overdose?\n\n- Why paracetamol?\n\n- What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\n- How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\n- What investigations are needed?\n\n- How can paracetamol overdose be treated?\n\nContinue reading below\n\n## What happens when you overdose on paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is usually taken by mouth and is available in tablet, caplet, soluble and liquid forms. The paracetamol passes via the stomach and intestine into the body and leads to pain relief and lowering of a high temperature (fever).\n\nAfter this, paracetamol is inactivated before being removed from the body. About 20% of the medicine is processed in the intestinal wall and the remainder in the liver. During this process, a small amount of a toxic compound (n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine, or NAPQI) is formed in the liver but this is quickly detoxified by a substance called glutathione.\n\nIn overdose, the stores of glutathione can be reduced so much that there isn't enough of it left to remove the increased amounts of NAPQI. The NAPQI then builds up and can damage the liver.\n\nParacetamol is the most common medicine that is taken as an overdose. It can lead to liver failure in just a few days, even if medication is given to protect the liver. Liver failure can be fatal.\n\nIn 2021, there were 227 deaths recorded in England and Wales due to paracetamol overdose. There were 261 deaths in 2022 from paracetamol overdose in England and Wales. There has been a general decrease in deaths from paracetamol overdoses since 1997 when there were 653 deaths in England and Wales.\n\n## Why would someone take an overdose?\n\nThere are many reasons why someone might take an overdose. This could be due to wish to end one's life or to cause serious self-harm. An overdose can also be taken accidentally - for example, toddlers may like the taste of liquid paracetamol and people with poor eyesight may take the wrong tablet by mistake.\n\nIn some, the act of taking an overdose is a spur-of-the-moment thing, whilst in others it can be pre-planned. Those who have pre-planned may have stockpiled medication, sorted out their affairs (such as writing a will) and also written a suicide note.\n\nSome people take higher than the recommended daily dose of paracetamol for pain over several days. They may not intend to kill themselves, and occasionally may not even realise they are harming themselves until they begin to feel unwell. This might also occur if they are taking two different preparations which both contain paracetamol.\n\nThe maximum number of paracetamol that should be taken within 24 hours is eight 500mg tablets. This includes any medication which contains paracetamol such as co-codamol or some cold and flu remedies.\n\nSome people are at increased risk of liver damage from paracetamol. This includes:\n\n- Those on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\nThose on certain medications, such as rifampicin, phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine and alcohol.\n\n- Those who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\nThose who are malnourished - for example, through chronic illness or eating disorders.\n\n- Those with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\nThose with alcohol-related liver disease.\n\n## Why paracetamol?\n\nParacetamol is widely available from shops and is present in most homes. The government has limited how much can be bought in one go which may help reduce the number of overdoses. It is reasonably easy to take and so the government has also ruled that it should only be available in blister packs which can mean the tablets are more difficult to get out in large numbers.\n\n## What are the symptoms of paracetamol overdose?\n\nThere may be no symptoms for the first day. A feeling of sickness (nausea) and being sick (vomiting) may occur a few hours after taking the overdose. After 24 hours there may be pain under the ribs on the right side (where the liver is) and there may be yellowing of the whites of the eyes and the skin (jaundice). Other features include:\n\n- The brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\nThe brain can also be affected with confusion and disorientation (called encephalopathy).\n\n- The kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\nThe kidneys can also be affected with a reduction in urine, and kidney failure can occur.\n\n- Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may occur.\n\n- There may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\nThere may be a build-up of acid in the blood, which can cause faster breathing.\n\n- There may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nThere may also be features of depression but not always.\n\nSometimes carers or family members discover that someone has taken an overdose. They may find empty packets or a suicide note. It is important to bring the empty packets and notes to the hospital.\n\n## How is paracetamol overdose assessed in hospital?\n\nThe healthcare professional will make a full assessment and will also ask about:\n\n- The number of tablets taken.\n\nThe number of tablets taken.\n\n- What time the overdose was taken.\n\nWhat time the overdose was taken.\n\n- Whether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\nWhether the medicine was in tablet, caplet, liquid or soluble form.\n\n- Whether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any other tablets were taken at the same time.\n\n- Whether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\nWhether any alcohol was taken at the same time.\n\n- Any suicide plans, such as whether a note was written."

Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter all over the world. Most commonly available concentrations are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume that doses available in different countries are similar. However, 500 mg/5 ml bottle is available in some countries including the United Kingdom. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent. We have reviewed the experience of diagnosing and managing an interesting case of paracetamol over dosage caused by several ingestions over 24 hours period (staggered paracetamol over dosage). It highlights the importance of communication between health professionals and parents while managing common medical problems.\n\nKeywords: Accidental poisoning, children, paracetamol\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\nParacetamol is one of the most commonly used drugs both over the counter and on prescription. It is used in infants and children for pain relief and as an antipyretic. Liquid paracetamol is available over the counter in the United Kingdom as 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml and rarely 500 mg/5 ml bottle. Many parents and healthcare professionals assume doses are 120 mg/5 ml and 250 mg/5 ml. This leaves a potential for accidental overdose with therapeutic intent, and we would like to report such a case.\n\n## CASE REPORT\n\nA 14-month-old toddler was referred by his General Practitioner (GP) giving a 3-day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The parents reported a febrile convulsion 1 week previously while in Spain, where they took the child to a secondary hospital and were prescribed paracetamol and ibuprofen four hourly, to control the fever. The child remained well and afebrile until the day before return, when he developed offensive bright yellow diarrhea with no blood or mucus. No other family members were affected. He was lethargic and was not eating or drinking. On examination he looked slightly jaundiced, had enlarged congested tonsils, and had a blanching viral rash on his arms, face, and torso. Other examination was unremarkable.\n\nParents told GP and pharmacist that 5 ml of paracetamol was given to child every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. Fortunately, parents also brought the empty paracetamol bottle with the child. When a curious medical student checked, it was discovered that the paracetamol suspension the family had obtained and used in Spain contained 500 mg/5 ml as opposed to the usual 120 mg/5 ml commonly available in the United Kingdom [Figure 1]. The Spanish hospital had prescribed the correct dose; however, there was a misunderstanding, because they were in Spanish. Therefore, the parents had been giving 500 mg every 4 hours.\n\n### Figure 1.\n\nParacetamol preparations of different strengths\n\nThis child weighed 10.4 kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300 mg/kg/day, double the 150 mg/kg/day level for treatment advised by the NPIS.[1] This dosage continued for 6 days until 2 days before hospital admission, when 120 mg/5 ml strength paracetamol was substituted. The child was diagnosed with staggered paracetamol overdose as the child was given toxic dose of paracetamol through several doses in 24 hours time and treated with N-acetylcysteine, as advised by the National poisons information service(NPIS).[1] Investigations including serum paracetamol level was less than 10 \u03bcg/ml and liver function tests both aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were less than 50 IU/l. He was discharged 4 days later with no further problems.\n\n## DISCUSSION\n\nParacetamol-induced hepatotoxicity remains a serious condition in pediatric practice.[2] Cases of paracetamol toxicity induced by multiple therapeutic or supratherapeutic doses of paracetamol have been reported.[3] The symptoms of paracetamol intoxication are nonspecific, making diagnosis and treatment of unintentional paracetamol intoxication more likely to be delayed.\n\nOur case illustrates that good communication between health professionals and parents is of paramount importance. The GP and pharmacist were told that 5 ml of paracetamol was given every 4 hours for the past 6 days, before the child was presented to hospital. It is understandable for them to assume that this was 120 mg/4 hours. Fortunately, on closer examination of the empty paracetamol bottle brought with the child, the diagnosis of paracetamol overdose was made. There are reported cases of acute hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation in children with the paracetamol over dosage.[2] Determination of serum paracetamol levels is useful in the management of paracetamol overdose when the time of the overdose is known with certainty. However, if the overdose is staggered over a long period, serum paracetamol tests are impossible to interpret and they can be normal. Therefore, clinician has to diagnose based on clinical history. Moreover, normal liver function tests and coagulation screening can be normal if paracetamol overdose does not affect the liver function. In our case these investigations were normal as reported in the literature.[3] Heubi et al reported[4] that 52% of cases of accidental pediatric overdose were erroneously given an adult preparation. This case highlights the importance of checking medications when patients return from abroad.\n\nThis problem is further increased when considering use of medicines in children as a whole. As Choonara states, many medicines are used in children off-licence.[5] This is often due to the increased costs to conduct clinical trials in children. If we are to increase the safety of medicines, then it may be necessary to look at unifying drug preparations or making parents and clinicians aware of the differences that exist.\n\n## CONCLUSIONS\n\nNow that travel is more commonplace and increasingly more people are being treated abroad, taking a full drug history in every patient including not only the prescribed amount but also the amount actually taken is clearly important. Finally, we need to be aware of the difficulties of communicating with patients where there is no common language. This should prevent further accidents.\n\n## Footnotes\n\nSource of Support: Nil\n\nConflict of Interest: None declared.\n\n## REFERENCES\n\n- 1.Guidelines for the management of acute paracetamol overdosage.

                "content": "Image caption, Taking slightly more than is recommended can cause significant damage over time\n\nByMichelle RobertsHealth reporter, BBC News\n\nTaking slightly too much paracetamol day after day can be fatal, experts have warned.A dangerous dose might just be a few pills too many taken regularly over days, weeks or months, they said.Researchers at Edinburgh University saw 161 cases of \"staggered overdose\" at its hospital over a 16-year period.People taking tablets for chronic pain might not realise they were taking too many or recognise symptoms of overdose and liver injury, they said.The researchers told the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology that this life-threatening condition could be easily missed by doctors and patients.Doctors may not initially spot the problem because blood tests will not show the staggeringly high levels of paracetamol seen with a conventional overdose, where someone may have swallowed several packets of the drug.\n\nPatients who have taken a staggered overdose tend to fare worse than those who have taken a large overdose, the study suggests.Dr Kenneth Simpson and colleagues looked at the medical records of 663 patients who had been referred with paracetamol-induced liver injury to the Scottish Liver Transplantation Unit at the university hospital.The 161 who had taken a staggered overdose were more likely to develop liver and brain problems and need kidney dialysis or help with their breathing. They were also more likely to die of their complications.Dr Simpson said: \"They haven't taken the sort of single-moment, one-off massive overdoses taken by people who try to commit suicide, but over time the damage builds up, and the effect can be fatal.\"Professor Roger Knaggs of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society said patients should heed the warning.\n\n\"If people experience pain and paracetamol doesn't help, rather than thinking a 'top up' dose may work, they should consult their pharmacist for alternative pain control or referral to someone who can help with the cause of the pain.\"The message is clear: if you take more paracetamol than is recommended, you won't improve your pain control but you may seriously damage your health.\"At this time of year people should also take care with combination cold and flu products which may have paracetamol as one of the ingredients. It's easy to take more than intended, so if in doubt consult your pharmacist.\"Meanwhile, researchers at King's College London and Lund University in Sweden say they have discovered precisely how paracetamol works in the body. It is via a protein on nerve cells called TRPA1, says Nature Communications.Now that they understand this principal mechanism, scientists can start to look for molecules that work in the same way to effectively relieve pain, but are less toxic and will not lead to serious complications following overdose.\n\n## More on this story\n\n- Child paracetamol dosages revisedPublished21 November 2011 - Painkillers 'risky in pregnancy'Published8 November 2010\n\n## Related internet links\n\n- British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology - Scottish Liver Transplant Unit\n\nThe BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."
