Since this topic needs special medical knowledge and has different legal rules depending on where you live, I focused on explaining the safest way to get proper help and guidance. It's like if someone asked me about a prescription medicine - I would want them to talk to their doctor who knows their specific situation, rather than giving general advice that might not be right for them.
