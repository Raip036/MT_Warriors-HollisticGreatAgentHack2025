Monitor your symptoms - if the pain is severe or persists more than a few days\n2. Watch for warning signs like:\n- Severe swelling\n- Inability to bear weight\n- Limited range of motion\n- Significant bruising\n\nWhile minor bumps often resolve with self-care, you should seek medical attention if:\n- Pain is severe or getting worse\n- You can't walk or put weight on it\n- The knee looks deformed\n- You develop fever or the area feels hot\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific information about any of these points?

I organized this information into simple, practical steps (like the RICE method) and explained it in friendly, everyday language - similar to how a helpful pharmacy worker would explain things over the counter.

Monitor your symptoms - if the pain is severe or persists more than a few days\n2. Watch for warning signs like:\n- Severe swelling\n- Inability to bear weight\n- Limited range of motion\n- Significant bruising\n\nWhile minor bumps often resolve with self-care, you should seek medical attention if:\n- Pain is severe or getting worse\n- You can't walk or put weight on it\n- The knee looks deformed\n- You develop fever or the area feels hot\n\nWould you like me to provide more specific information about any of these points? Please note that while I can offer general guidance, a healthcare provider should evaluate persistent or severe knee pain for proper diagnosis and treatment.",
